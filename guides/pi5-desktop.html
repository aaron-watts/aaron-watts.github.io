        <p id="intro">
            This is less of a guide, and more just an outline of how,
            and why, I'm doing it. As well as a review of how it's
            going. It's not here as clickbait, you might not want to
            do it yourself, but I'm here to say that it's working for
            me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I know. There are hundreds of articles on this. But they
            are all out to prove that something is worth doing or not.
            This isn't that. It's not hyped up, undeserving praise, nor
            is it phobic criticism. I have genuinely switched from a
            <em>classical</em> desktop computer, to using a Raspberry Pi
            5, and it works for me. Really well, in fact!
        </p>

        <h2 id="why">But, why?</h2>
        <p>
            This might be the wrong question. Maybe, it was more: how?
            I don't work in tech, it's just a hobby of mine. Nor do I make
            heaps of expendable money to blow on tech. My last desktop
            computer was a Dell Optiplex 3050, with some variant of an
            intel i5 processor. I found it next to the communal bins
            outside my flat. There was nothing wrong with it. I adopted
            it, cleaned it, installed linux, plugged in some additional
            RAM and it was a great computer. I even found an old AMD
            graphics card that fit it. It's still here, it still works.
            I was trying out the i3wm community edition of EndeavourOS,
            and it was great (I love i3wm!). There was an update a little
            while ago to lightDM, the login manager for that flavour of
            EndeavourOS. I fixed it on my laptop at work, which also runs
            the same flavour distro, but I suppose the graphics card in
            my desktop means there's extra steps to take for the desktop,
            I dunno, I still haven't looked yet. But I also didn't want
            to lose some files from my SSD, so I've left it on the shelf
            until I can be bothered to sort that out. What's important
            about that story, is it broke in the morning, as I was
            about to begin the work I do as my job for the day. I didn't
            have anything else on hand to do my job, and I needed to
            clock in soon. As luck would have it, my Macbook Pro 2012's
            keyboard had just degraded beyond the point of no return a
            week or two prior, which left me a little stuck.
        </p>
        <p>
            What I <em>did</em> have, was a Raspberry Pi 4 on my desk.
            Yes, I know, this is about Raspberry Pi 5, I will get to that.
            Anyway, we've all seen the misleading videos on youtube that
            make sponsor-bucks by luring viewers into assuming that a
            pi 4 will run as their daily driver and get the job done.
            I know better than to rely on it. But for my job, which is
            mostly emails, documents, spreadsheets, and some databases
            that look like they were designed to run in internet explorer,
            it seemed like it might be enough to get through the day.
            So I powered up my pi 4, and did my job. And, it worked. I
            mean, it was a little slower than I was used to, and it did
            struggle a little at times, but I got everything done that
            I needed to. And then a few days later, while I was working
            and my trusty pi 4 was ticking along shouldering its load,
            I got a notification that the pi 5 was now in stock. I bought
            my pi 5, from my pi 4. Neat.
        </p>
        <p>
            My pi 4 got reassigned, and I set up the 5 with the new version
            of the argon one case and an M.2. NVME SSD drive, and just ..
            carried on working.
        </p>

        <h2 id="good-enough">Is it good enough?</h2>
        <p>
            Yes. I mean, for me, it is. I won't lie, pi 4 can get the job
            done. But it suffers while it does it, and at the end of the
            day, it goes home, falls straight to sleep, all the while
            growing more and more distant from it's wife and children.
            The pi 5, on the other hand, doesn't yet comprehend the
            evils and injustices of the world, and has enough ambition
            and energy to perform at it's tasks, and get to live a
            good quality of life at the end of the day too.
        </p>
        <p>
            What do you want it to do? Personally, I use my pi for the
            work I've already mentioned, some coding, and guides and
            nerdery. I'm not trying to game on it, I'm not trying to
            edit videos on it. Though, there is evidence on youtube
            that it can actually do the latter to an acceptable standard!
            There are, naturally, some hurdles involved with integrating
            a linux device into a world that doesn't even know it's name.
            And too, the ARM architecture causes one or two nags here and
            there. But things are improving, all the time, and for my use
            case, I've been able to get everything running in a way that
            causes me no hinderence, to the point that this is now the
            only computer on my desk.
        </p>
        <p>
            One huge win over using a more typical device, is the
            electricity usage. It uses almost none. I leave this pi, and
            another that I use specifically as a web radio and music
            streaming device running volumio, both running all day long.
            All day. It uses less electric than making toast in the toaster
            ONCE. I shit you not. If you care about the environment or the
            energy crisis, that should make you happy. But if like me,
            you are more concerned with keeping your pockets lined with
            copper, then you should also get a kick out of that too.
        </p>

        <h2 id="setup">My set up</h2>
        <h3>Operating System and Desktop Environment</h3>
        <p>
            I went with Raspberry Pi OS. I haven't changed the desktop
            environment at all. It defaults to wayland, I've looked at
            the X desktop, but I've found no real reason to switch yet.
            Wayland has an issue with the system tray icons, KDE Connect
            and Nextcloud don't appear up there, but that hasn't bothered
            me so far. This flavour of LXDE isn't the most modern looking,
            and changing it takes a lot more work than I'm willing to
            invest. But there is a charm to the default pi desktop, and
            it's fun to see the little changes here and there as they
            continue to work on it. Besides, how much time do you spend
            really looking at your desktop and the window textures once
            an app is open?
        </p>
        <p>
            You could no doubt choose a more modern looking OS. But pi's
            own OS does everything well enough for me, and as usual I get
            the best possible compatibility with accessories, as well as
            having the best operating system possible for when I work on
            my guides.
        </p>

        <h3>Software</h3>
        <p>
            Nextcloud and KDE Connect both work, and are both available
            in the apt repo's, which is great. For
            writing code I use
            <a href="https://vscodium.com/#install-on-debian-ubuntu-deb-package"
                >VSCodium</a>, which is an opensource version of VSCode,
            and has a lot of the same extensions available for it. There
            is a VSCode in apt, but it is from Microsofts repo, so aside
            from installing bloat, some people may not like that.
        </p>
        <p>
            LibreOffice is a great office suite, and I genuinely love it.
            However, everyone where I work is inside of the Microsoft
            ecosystem, and LibreOffice doesn't always play well with
            Microsoft Office. In my experience, OnlyOffice integrates
            very well with the Microsoft Suite, and I've been able to
            collaborate with my colleagues with virtually no issues at
            all using it. But. And it's a big but. It's not compatible
            with ARM architecture. All is not lost, however, as OnlyOffice
            is integrated into Nextcloud, so you can use it online with
            any Nextcloud provider, or even your own.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everything else I do is online. Most of my work apps refuse
            to work in aything besides chrome or edge, so I just use
            chromium for work, and I have firefox for play time. There
            isn't much else for me to say on software. I live a simple
            life, do I not?
        </p>

        <h3>Peripherals</h3>
        <p>
            One thing I do have to do online, a lot more often than I
            would like to, is conference calls. My employer uses MS
            Teams, which is a resource hog, and has caused many of my
            intel devices to struggle and stutter. I am, however, pleased
            to say that the pi 5 handles these calls with grace. Of
            course, you don't get a webcam or microphone built into a
            raspberry pi, and plug and play compatibility on any linux
            device can be shaky at best if you aren't prepared to do
            an extensive amount of research. If you want to get going
            quickly here, then I have reccomendations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The microphone I am using is a <a
            href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/SAMSON-30-10004-Samson-SAMTR-Microphone/dp/B004J3X47A/"
            target="_blank">Samson Meteor Mic</a>, it is a 1950's style,
            chrome studio microphone that is genuine plug and play
            on linux. I just plugged it in and it worked flawlessly.
            It features a hard mute button, as well as a headphone
            port, for when you need to drown out some background
            noise in order to hear the meeting.
        </p>
        <p>
            A microphone is the minimum you need to take part in an
            online meeting, so that's sorted. But people might start
            to talk about you if you are the only one that never turns
            your camera on.
            I'm not saying affordable plug and play webcams for linux
            don't exist, but if they do, I haven't been able to find
            them. Searching for linux webcam on amazon did get me a
            result, but when I plugged it in, there were hoops to
            jump through, and then a setting in the cheese application
            broke it. But, for what I think is a fairly reasonable
            price, you can pick up a Raspberry Pi Zero 2, and a
            Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3, and put together your own
            truly plug and play webcam by following
            <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/tutorials/plug-and-play-raspberry-pi-usb-webcam/"
            target="_blank">this actually quite simple tutorial</a>.
            The Camera 3 Module actually yields pretty good
            camera quality as far as webcams go. And also, with chrome
            and ribbon cables all over your desk, you do start to feel
            pretty darn cyberpunk!
        </p>

        <h2 id="youtube">Youtube</h2>
        <p>
            I suppose we do have to talk about it. It's the real question,
            after all, isn't it? Yes. It's watchable. I can run youtube
            on fullscreen in chromium, at 1080p 60fps. It drops some frames,
            but in my opinion, it's completely watchable. Running it 720p
            60fps drops very few frames at all. But, if running youtube on a
            raspberry pi is all that
            matters to you, then you should maybe look at installing android
            on a raspberry pi instead.
