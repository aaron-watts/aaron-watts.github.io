        <img src="/images/nespi-4.jpg" alt="">
        <p id="intro">
            The Raspberry Pi 4, with Retroflag's NesPi 4 Case, running RetroPie
            is the ultimate retro gaming rig. Low power consumption? Check.
            Light gun games? You got it. Great customisation options? Of course.
            Did you know you can even use a wiimote as the stylus for the Drastic
            Nintendo DS Emulator?? Did I hear someone say Wario Ware?
        </p>
        <p>
            I've gone through a few different renditions of hardware, cases
            and software for my retrogaming rig. I use Recalbox on a GPi case
            2 with compute module 4 (no wifi), and have also used it on this
            device. However, I found myself coming back to RetroPie for the
            NesPi 4 case and my main rig. Recalbox is certainly a great
            piece of software, and even has easy set up for the case, however
            RetroPie just lets you do so much more, and also I found Recalbox
            to occasionally break after updates - not often, but often enough
            for me to notice a pattern.
        </p>

        <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

        <p>
            The NesPi 4 Case gives you the option to use an SSD drive
            cunningly disguised as a NES cartridge for additional storage.
            But, given the faster speeds and greater reliability of SSD
            via USB for the raspberry pi, the smarter play is to boot from
            it and throw out the SD card. You might need to update EEPROM
            to get it going, I didn't in this case. If you bought the spare
            <em>cartridge</em> it comes with a case that lets you plug it
            into your computer, so do that, and flash a fresh copy of
            RetroPie to the disk using the Raspberry Pi Imager, or etcher
            if you so choose. If you didn't get the adapter, you will want
            to dig one out from your drawer of wires, or order one online.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            Note: RetroPie images can be found in the Raspberry Pi Imager, or
            online at <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/download/">RetroPie</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            First boot should prompt you to map your gamepad. Once done
            you can get your pi online and get its IP from the RetroPie
            menu, and ssh into it to install the NesPi 4 safe shutdown
            script:
        </p>
<pre>
wget -O - "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RetroFlag/retroflag-picase/master/install.sh" | sudo bash</pre>
        
        <p>
            There's plenty of themes and splash screens to choose from,
            so make the pi yours (I went with a smart looking Nintendo
            theme and splash myself), and move to the next step when
            you're ready.
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="bios">BIOS files</h2>
        <p>
            So now games? No. Slow down there. Some of the emulators
            are plug'n'play, but for some to run you will need BIOS's.
            As much as I love being told to google it by people in
            forums, it's not helpful, and you can often end up with
            files that don't work. Someone has been kind enough to collate
            a <a href="https://github.com/archtaurus/RetroPieBIOS">BIOS set</a>
            on github, you can simply copy all contents into
            your BIOS directory, or copy in as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're not familiar with how git works, and need some
            extra help just follow the steps below.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            Note: these instructions are assuming you are working on
            a different device to the pi.
        </p>
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/archtaurus/RetroPieBIOS.git
cd RetroPieBIOS</pre>
        <p>
            Get your pi's local IP address, but don't SSH in. Either copy
            the entire BIOS set over, or cherry pick what you need:
        </p>
<pre>
# to copy entire directory
rsync -r BIOS/ &lt;user&gt;@&lt;ip_address&gt;:~/RetroPie/BIOS

# or to pick out a single file
cd BIOS
rsync &lt;bios_file&gt; &lt;user&gt;@&lt;ip_address&gt;:~/RetroPie/BOIS/</pre>
        <p>
            If that scares yesterdays dinner out of you, then just
            plug your SSD (or SD card if you are unwilling to take good
            advice) back into the computer and do it all the old
            fashioned way.
        </p>

        <h2 id="games">Getting Games</h2>
        <p>
            I have no idea if I'm legally allowed to tell you where to
            download digital copies of games you already own, but
            <a href="https://www.techpout.com/safe-rom-sites/">these guys</a>
            don't seem to give a toss. There's some good sources there.
            EmuParadise stopped working, but if you install the tampermonkey
            extension on firefox, the following script adds a workaround
            which you can <em>right click</em> and choose <em>save as</em>
            to download.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            Note: workaround doesn't work when there are multiple download
            sources on a page - a common thing for Dreamcast images.
        </p>

        <p>
            To get your games over to your pi, check the
            <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/docs/">RetroPie Docs</a> to
            make sure that your roms are in the correct format, then copy
            them over the old fashioned way or with rsync to the correct
            directory. I'm feeling generous today so I'll write a bash
            script that can simplify the procedure, I'll put it here later.
            Otherwise, if you're chicken, use USB.
        </p>
        <p class="note">Note: Use the built in scrapers on the RetroPie
            start menu to get cover art and game descriptions, you might
            need to run each once to get all your games list done. If some
            still don't work, they may need their file names adjusted in
            order to be found.

        </p>
        <h3>N64</h3>

        <h3>Dreamcast</h3>

        <h3>PSP</h3>

        <h2 id="menu-music">Menu Music</h2>
        <p>
            But RetroPie doesn't have menu music, I hear you say. That
            may be, but out of the linux based emulation station 
            frontends, it's the least opinionated, so we can just add it
            ourselves. Neat! First download whatever music you want running
            on the menu, and place it in <code>~/pi/bgm/</code> - as many
            as you want. I only went with one, I used the nintendo wii
            menu soundtrack to go with my nintendo theme. Next install
            mpg123:
        </p>
<pre>
sudo apt install mpg123</pre>

        <p>
            Next we will want to add the following to the
            <code>/opt/retropie/configs/all/autostart.sh</code> file:
        </p>

<pre>
while pgrep omxplayer >/dev/null; do sleep 1; done
(sleep 10; mpg123 -Z /home/pi/bgm/*.mp3 >/dev/null 2>&1) &
    
emulationstation #auto</pre>

        <p>
            And in the
            <code>/opt/retropie/configs/all/runcommand-onstart.sh</code>
            file, create one if it doesn't already exist:
        </p>

<pre>
pkill -STOP mpg123</pre>

        <p>
            And then the
            <code>/opt/retropie/configs/all/runcommand-onend.sh</code>
            file, again: create if it doesn't exist:
        </p>

<pre>
pkill -CONT mpg123</pre>
        <p>
            And finally we just need to make those last two files
            executable:
        </p>
<pre>
sudo chmod a+x /opt/retropie/configs/all/runcommand-onstart.sh
sudo chmod a+x /opt/retropie/configs/all/runcommand-onend.sh</pre>
        <p>Reboot for moods.</p>

        <h2 id="lightgun">Lightgun Games</h2>
        <p>
            This was surprisingly simple to get going. I don't really
            play MAME games, and there's plenty of guides for the
            MAME lightgun games anyway, jfgi if that's what you're
            here for. You will need a
            <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mayflash-W010-Dolphin-Bar-Wireless/dp/B00HZWEB74"
                target="_blank"
            >Mayflash Dolphin Bar</a>, a wiimote, and to do it properly,
            a wiimote pistol adaptor. With RetroPie, at least, the dolphin
            bar is plug and play - although you will need to adjust
            settings in the retroarch menu. You can only use one wiimote
            per dolphin bar sadly, I'm not entirely sure a second bar will
            give you a second wiimote as it works by using the wiimote to
            emulate mouse and cursor control, but the brave and/or rich
            among you are welcome to give it a try.

            It will only work with the libretro cores, which is most
            of what you will be using. It won't work with Redream,
            Drastic, or PPSSPP emulators - but unless you've replaced
            the lr cores for different ones, it should run on every
            other emulator you will be using.
