                I built this media centre at the start of 2024. There may
                be easier methods of installation by now. When I built this
                project, existing guides mentioned an installation image
                on KDE's bigscreen page, however, it doesn't seem to exist
                currently, except for a manjaro image, and I prefer to stick
                to Raspberry Pi's own debian OS when I can, especially that
                it ensures the best compatibility with things like cases and
                accessories.
