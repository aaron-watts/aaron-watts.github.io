            Some guides on things that I have worked on where resources are
            either hard to find or scattered. You might save yourself some
            time or learn something new if you're working on anything that
            comes up in this section.

            Technology that I consider to be

            , where
            there are more meaningful priorities than exponential
            growth and high profit margins.

I was running my own skate school and needed something that could organise data while on the move; specifically bookings I had made with clients. I had looked at a lot of options which didn't quite make the cut of what I needed. But then I stumbled across AppSheet, and it did just about everything I needed it to. Well, almost everything. But as it uses Google Sheets as pseudo-databases, I was able to use Apps Script to fill the last few gaps, and have my own custom software .. for free!</p></div>
