            You don't always need a full stack. When all you need to
            do is show information, a static website is enough. And
            with Github Pages, it is possible to have a fully
            functioning website for free, just like this one! It could
            just be the perfect solution for your portfolio page.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, in 2024, static sites can do a bit more than just
            send information. This site, for example, has a 
            <a href="#comment-section">comment section</a> on each
            project page (scroll down and see for yourself). There's
            an oceans-worth of webdev lessons and tutorials out there,
            but not many really talk about getting the site up, and
            indexed. So instead of talking about how to code a website,
            I thought I'd go over some of the things I've learned in 
            building this website and getting it bing-ready, as well
            as some of the interesting things you can get working on
            static websites today.
        </p>

        <h2 id="cms">Why Not a CMS?</h2>
        <p>
            Good question. You can absolutely use a Content Management
            System. Github Pages even has one incorporated into it, 
            it's called
            <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>.
            But I had a very specific vision for my website. Story time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I bought my domain name a while ago. I had been learning
            web development, and thought I might like to do it
            professionally. And so, naturally I would need an online
            portfolio. Eventually, I changed my mind, and decided that
            I prefer to play with mono fonts as a hobby, so I scrapped
            that idea. But I kept the domain name, just in case I
            decided I might eventually want to do something with it.
            And I did, I'm doing it now, it's this site. Anyway, when
            I was learning all these amazing CSS and Javascript spells
            and incantations, two things would often happen. The first
            was that more
            code would lead to more bugs, and the other thing was that
            I was never satisified with a project. I would always want
            to improve or fix something, and nothing ever got finished.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then I came across a website, just some
            <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/" 
            target="_blank">motherfucking website</a>, and I realised
            then, that less is more. When I decided I wanted to build
            this website to log my projects, I decided I wanted it to
            follow those design principles (or lack there of). In
            doing very little, I wanted to acheive a responsive,
            hierarchical website that just worked everywhere, and
            loaded up <em>fast</em>. You don't get that with CMS's.
            And to that end, I use very little javascript on this site
            (even though I love javascript), it highlights my syntax,
            runs a filter feature on the home page, and runs the
            comments sections on these projects pages. I don't import
            fonts, and as much as possible is hosted in the website
            itself. The only external service is the comments because,
            well, static.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, to keep to those design principles, I've opted to do
            everything myself (and also because I enjoy coding).
            Although, that doesn't mean things have to be difficult
            either. After looking at the things you need to get done
            to pass the bing test, we will take a look at automating
            some of the tedious stuff with python scripts.
