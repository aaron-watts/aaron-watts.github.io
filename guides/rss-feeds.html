        <p id="intro">
            RSS isn't really something you hear spoken about too often. But for
            us nerds, it's an indisposable technology. And thankfully, it still gets
            used. Most of the time, if you need an RSS feed for content you've made,
            the software you've used to make said content has probably already done
            it for you, you might need not even know. But if you had to make one
            yourself, would you know how?
        </p>
        <p>
            The docs at the <a href="https://www.rssboard.org/" 
            target="_blank">RSS Advisory Board</a> are ... confusing, to a newcomer.
            Also, if you try to learn by looking at other website's feeds, it
            doesn't really work as every single feed is built differently from the
            last. And not to achieve new objectives, mind you. But I have been exploring
            the technology a little, and I think I've worked out a relatively simple
            formula to have a feature rich RSS feed (for something like a blog at least)
            that should work across most, if not all, RSS feed aggregators.
        </p>

        <h2 id="feature-rich">A Feature Rich Feed</h2>
        <p>
            I previously touched on RSS Feeds in my article about
            <a href="/guides/github-pages-static-website"
            target="_blank">Github Pages static websites</a>, where I put together
            a simple python script to build the RSS feed for this site, among other
            things. Since then, this website has grown a little, as has the feed.
            Back then, the feed was already handling atom, as well as including
            media images. But the most important feature was missing: the
            <em>content</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The best thing about RSS, in my opinion, is being able to read full news
            articles without ads and pop-ups suggesting that you subscribe or set
            your cookie permissions. Other feeds often use something called
            CDATA, but that didn't mix well with the python XML module
            that I was using. Luckily, I soon worked out that the content namespace
            included an encoded element, and it turned out that it did exactly what I
            needed it to. Without CDATA, you can use pure html within the element
            for it to be displayed in it's document form in RSS feed readers. To
            that means, if you write a blog, or articles, you can include the entire
            html within that tag (provided you are not relying too heavily in CSS
            or JavaScript trickery). Here is the current layout of my RSS feeds:
        </p>
        <aside>
            NOTE: I haven't included the content:encoded element so it doesn't break <em>my</em>
            RSS feed!
        </aside>
        <pre class="language-xml"><code>&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?&gt;

    &lt;/channel&gt;
&lt;/rss&gt;</code></pre>

        <h2 id="namespaces">Namespaces</h2>
        <p>
            If you're familiar with XML, then you already know that namespaces let
            us extend an XML document with tags that aren't already included within
            the specification (in this case, RSS) that we are already using. In this
            feed I have included the namespaces for
            <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" target="_blank">Atom</a>,
            <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" target="_blank">Media</a> and
            <a href="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/" target="_blank">Content</a>.
        </p>
        <h2 id="atom">Atom</h2>
        <p>
            Atom is another XML feed specification. Without divulging in too much history,
            it was a new (at the time) XML feed specification that was different from RSS,
            but by including it's namespace in our RSS feed, and atom:link-ing the feed
            to itself (which shows as an error in RSS validators, but is also encouraged
            by the RSS Board - I told you RSS is confusing), our RSS feed also becomes a
            valid Atom feed. Just put it through an Atom validator to see for yourself.
        </p>
        <h2 id="media">Media</h2>
        <p>
            The Media namespace lets us include media images. The enclosure element
            built into the RSS spec also does that, but not every RSS reader will show
            an enclosure image. Media has a much higher success rate, although while
            testing different aggregators, I have found that Media also doesn't work
            with certain readers. There are other ways to show images, but so far I
            have found that this combination will meet protocol for most, if not all,
            RSS aggregators.
        </p>
        <h2 id="content">Content</h2>
        <p>
            The Content namespace lets us include, well, content. The docs for it
            seem to show CDATA elements, and a lot of RSS feeds out there do just that.
            However, I have found that escaped HTML works fine if you just drop it
            inside the <code>content:encoded</code> element. I haven't found an aggregator
            yet that doesn't display it, but with the fast and loose rules to RSS, I
            am sure that said aggregator exists.
        </p>
        <h2 id="dates">Dates</h2>
        <p>
            I'm only using pubDate in my feed, there are a few other useful elements
            that are date typed depending on what you are trying to acheive. Dates
            are RFC 822 format. What does that mean?? Eventually I found out through
            using an RSS validator, and it does appear to be included in the RSS Board
            docs now (I'm convinced it wasnt' before, but I could be unobservant and
            wrong). It means that dates should be formatted like so:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-none"><code>Sat, 07 Sep 2002 09:42:31 GMT</code></pre>
        <h2 id="guid">GUID</h2>
        <p>
            GUID stands for Globally Uniquie Identifier. Aggregators use this to
            check if an RSS item is new. I try to avoid mistakes when I can, but if
            I need to go back and fix a typo, this element will preventing aggregators
            from fetching the item a second time. I tend to just use the url path
            for the article as the ID, as it is the only article that will ever have that exact
            url.
        </p>
        <h2 id="automation">Python Automation</h2>
        <p>
            I won't go into a lot of detail here, as most of it will already be
            covered in the previous article about <a href="/guides/github-pages-static-website"
            target="_blank">Github Pages Static Websites</a>, but there was a little
            trial and error invloved with getting the pre elements to format correctly
            in the content encoded RSS elements. Also relative links all needed to
            be replaced with absolute links, and as a bonus I'll include the date
            formatting, even though we both know you could have worked that out
            for yourself pretty easily.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is the python function to format the content encoded HTML.
            It prefers to put everything on one line, except for pre elements
            as they need to include line breaks to be displayed correctly.
        </p>
        <pre class="language-python"><code>'''
format_main_content will remove new lines from html elements
except for pre elements where it will preserve them
'''
def format_main_content(content):
    content_str = ''
    for child in content.children:
        if child.name == 'pre':
            content_str += str(child)
        else:
            content_str += ' '.join(str(child).split())
    return content_str

'''
format_main_content is called when scraping the files with
the BeautifulSoup module
'''
main_element = article_soup.select_one('main')
content = format_main_content(main_element)

articles.append({
    ...
    'content': content,
    ...
})

'''
Finally I need to explicitly remove those new lines,
the previous formatting will stop any issues with pre
elements, and finally all relative links are replaced
with absolute links
'''
str(article['content'])
.strip()
.replace('\\n', '')
.replace('="/', '="https://aaronwatts.dev/')</code></pre>
        <p>
            The date formatting is pretty straightforward. I don't include
            a time so I just add an arbitrary one in.
        </p>
        <pre class="language-python"><code>'''
I use a time element for the published date
'''
html_date = article_soup.select_one('time')
article_date = date.fromisoformat(html_date['datetime'])
formatted_date = article_date.strftime('%a, %d %b %Y')

articles.append({
    ...
    'formatted_date' : formatted_date + ' 08:00:00 GMT',
    ...
})</code></pre>
