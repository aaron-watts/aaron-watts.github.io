            With the introduction of Web Manifest V3, ad blocking in
            Chromium based browsers is changing. the new limitations
            and API's for browser extensions means ad blockers, such
            as Ublock Origin are less effective than they once were.
            Firefox will still be using Manifest V2 for a while yet,
            but the fact that Firefox, on the dekstop at least, does
            not have support for PWA's (progressive web apps) may
            hinder the user experience for those off us using Plasma
            Bigscreen as a streaming OS. Luckily, Linux is flexible,
            and there's an easy way to get Firefox Web Apps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Web Apps on Linux are not new, and while it would be time
            consuming, you could potentially just right your own
            dekstop files to open specified url's in their own
            windows. Thankfully, Linux Mint's Web Apps software has
            been ported over to the Raspberry Pi, so we can get set
            up with Firefox PWA's pretty quickly, and without fuss.
          </p>
          <aside>
            NOTE: This guide is for installing Firefox PWA's on a 
            Raspberry Pi device running KDE Plasma Bigscreen, find 
            out how to get Bigscreen running on a Pi
            <a href="/guides/kde-plasma-bigscreen">here</a>.

          <h2>Firefox on Pi</h2>
          <p>
            Raspberry Pi OS used to ship with Chromium as it's
            default browser, and while the Ubuntu image for
            Rapsberry Pi delivered decent performance with Firefox,
            it did tend to struggle on Raspberry Pi OS. These issues
            appear to have been fixed, and you can now select
            Firefox or Chromium as the default browser when setting
            up the desktop. The Raspberry Pi Foundation has even
            included their own Firefox extension, called
            <code>UANaughtyList</code>, that simply changes the
            user agent to improve the experience on Youtube and
            Netflix (you <em>ARE</em> naughty, Youtube and Netflix!).
          </p>
          <p>
            To install Firefox on Raspberry Pi OS with the necessary
            extensions, open terminal in type the following:
          </p>
          <pre class="language-none command-line"
          data-user="aaronwatts" data-host="dev"><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install firefox rpi-firefox-mods</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section id="install">
          <h2>Installation</h2>
          <p>
          Installation is pretty simple, but you will want the
          flexibility of multiple windows, so first log out of
          the Bigscreen session, and log in to the Plasma desktop
          session before starting.
          </p>
          <p>
          To install Linux Mint's Web Apps software, we first need
          to install <a href="https://pi-apps.io/"
          target="_blank">Pi-Apps</a>. Installing Pi-Apps is simple
          enough and can be done with one line in the terminal:
          </p>
          <pre class="language-none command-line"
          data-user="aaronwatts" data-host="dev"><code>wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Botspot/pi-apps/master/install | bash</code></pre>
          <p>
          Once Pi-Apps is installed, open it, and install 
          <code>Web Apps</code> from the <code>Internet</code>
          category in the software list.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="webapps">
          <h2>Setting Up Web Apps</h2>
          <p>
            Setting up web apps is easy. Just open the Web Apps
            software and click <code>+</code> to create a new app.
            Give the app a name, and enter the url. Once you have
            typed the url, there is a button next to the field that
            will scrape the url for favicons that you can use as the
            apps icon on the dekstop. It's success rate for finding
            favicons is extremely good, but not quite 100%, so you
            may occasionally need to download the icon and set it
            manually.
            You can choose which web browser to launch a specific
            application in, so if a site struggles in firefox, you
            can select a different browser for that particular
            application.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's all there is to it. After setting up your web
            apps, simply log back into the Bigscreen session and
            enjoy your favourite shows.
