        <p id="intro">
            You don't always need a full stack. When all you need to
            do is show information, a static website is enough. And
            with Github Pages, it is possible to have a fully
            functioning website for free, just like this one! It could
            just be the perfect solution for your portfolio page.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, in 2024, static sites can do a bit more than just
            send information. This site, for example, has a 
            <a href="#comment-section">comment section</a> on each
            project page (scroll down and see for yourself). There's
            an oceans-worth of webdev lessons and tutorials out there,
            but not many really talk about getting the site up, and
            indexed. So instead of talking about how to code a website,
            I thought I'd go over some of the things I've learned in 
            building this website and getting it bing-ready, as well
            as some of the interesting things you can get working on
            static websites today.
        </p>

        <h2 id="cms">Why Not a CMS?</h2>
        <p>
            Good question. You can absolutely use a Content Management
            System. Github Pages even has one incorporated into it, 
            it's called
            <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>.
            But I had a very specific vision for my website. Story time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I bought my domain name a while ago. I had been learning
            web development, and thought I might like to do it
            professionally. And so, naturally I would need an online
            portfolio. Eventually, I changed my mind, and decided that
            I prefer to play with mono fonts as a hobby, so I scrapped
            that idea. But I kept the domain name, just in case I
            decided I might eventually want to do something with it.
            And I did, I'm doing it now, it's this site. Anyway, when
            I was learning all these amazing CSS and Javascript spells
            and incantations, two things would often happen. The first
            was that more
            code would lead to more bugs, and the other thing was that
            I was never satisified with a project. I would always want
            to improve or fix something, and nothing ever got finished.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then I came across a website, just some
            <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/" 
            target="_blank">motherfucking website</a>, and I realised
            then, that less is more. When I decided I wanted to build
            this website to log my projects, I decided I wanted it to
            follow those design principles (or lack there of). In
            doing very little, I wanted to acheive a responsive,
            hierarchical website that just worked everywhere, and
            loaded up <em>fast</em>. You don't get that with CMS's.
            And to that end, I use very little javascript on this site
            (even though I love javascript), it highlights my syntax,
            runs a filter feature on the home page, and runs the
            comments sections on these projects pages. I don't import
            fonts, and as much as possible is hosted in the website
            itself. The only external service is the comments because,
            well, static.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, to keep to those design principles, I've opted to do
            everything myself (and also because I enjoy coding).
            Although, that doesn't mean things have to be difficult
            either. After looking at the things you need to get done
            to pass the bing test, we will take a look at automating
            some of the tedious stuff with python scripts.
        </p>

        <h2 id="github-pages">Github Pages</h2>
        <p>
            So, assuming you've got a basic website built and ready
            to go, you will need somewhere to serve the files from.
            I'm not savvy enough to want to brave self hosting on
            a home server, so I opted for
            <a href="https://pages.github.com/"
            target="_blank">Github Pages</a>. 
            If you're here reading this, then chances are you either
            have a github account, or are familiar with the git CLI.
            Github Pages websites are free, though there are
            limitations to them, but for a portfolio page, a blog,
            or documentation it is ideal.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are 2 different types of github pages websites.
            The first is the user/organisation site. This will
            give you a url in the format
            <code>&lt;username&gt;.github.io</code>, which, in
            itself is pretty tidy as far as free url's go. You will 
            be able to use advanced DNS configuration with a DNS 
            provider such as namecheap if you go this route, meaning
            it will be much easier to set up with search engines.
            The second is a project site. Although trickier, it is
            still possible to set up a custom domain in this case, 
            and without advanced DNS configuration, setting up with
            search engines will involve adding meta tags into the
            site headers for verification.
        </p>

        <h2 id="custom-domain">Custom Domain Name</h2>
        <p>
            You don't need a custom domain name. But with a DNS
            provider, such as
            <a target="_blank" 
            href="https://www.namecheap.com/">namecheap</a>,
            you get the benefit of advnaced DNS configuration,
            making it far easier to set up SEO, using CNAME and
            txt records, instead of uglying up your code with
            unnecessary meta tags. Also, <code>&lt;yourname&gt;.com</code>
            looks far nicer, and more professional, than
            <code>&lt;yourname&gt;.github.io</code>. The process for getting
            custom domains set up for user and organisation
            pages is pretty thoroughly documented by gihtub
            <a 
                href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site"
                target="_blank"
            >here</a>. For project pages, there is a solution
            that worked for me over at Stack Overflow
            <a 
                href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/9123911"
                target="_blank"
            >here</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="bing">Getting Bing Ready</h2>
        <p>
            Okay, so Bing is not the only search engine. But
            out of Bing and Google, Bing is definitely the
            hard-arse parent that isn't goint to tolerate any
            slack from you. Google is quite lax, provided your
            url's are all correct and your site is verified.
            But Bing runs a number of tests and won't index
            if your site fails them. The only other remaining
            <em>pure search engines</em> remaining today,
            might be Yahoo and DuckDuckGo, but both of those
            pull indexes off of Bing, so through the hoops
            we jump. There may well be more issues than what
            I bring up here, but assuming you're starting
            with something like the emmet boilerplate, you
            shouldn't run in to too many more than I did.
        </p>
        <h3>H1's</h3>
        <p>
            They tried to tell you. You didn't listen.
            Semantics is important. But you kept following
            those CSS guru's on youtube like they were bitches
            on heat. Now all you know about web dev is how to
            nest spans in divs in spans in divs to make a
            sidemenu icon change shape when the menu is hidden.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bing wants to see a h1 on every page. Be smart and
            use it on the <em>main title</em> of the 
            <em>relevant content</em> of each page. I didn't
            really see the need for one on my
            <a href="/" target="_blank"
            >splash page</a>, but Bing flagged it, so I had to
            put one in and cancel the styling on it.
        </p>

        <h3>Alt-txt</h3>
        <p>
            Yes, semantics is important. And yes, I regularly
            forget to put the alt-txt on images. Oh, fine. I
            just don't bother, I remember and then decide I'm
            too lazy to do it. Anyway, Bing pulled me on it,
            and now I try to be a good web dev.
        </p>

        <h3>Meta Description</h3>
        <p>
            SEO has changed over the years, and search engines
            rely less on the meta tags in html headers than they
            used to. However, Bing still wants a meta desription
            tag, it won't index a page without one. You can throw
            in the meta keywords lists and all other bells and
            whistles if you wish, but just make sure the description
            is in their, as it seems to be the one Bing cares about.
        </p>

        <h3>Favicon</h3>
        <p>
            Technically, this wasn't really an obstacle to getting
            indexed, but it is rumoured that it can improve your
            ranking in search engines, and it also get's rid of that
            annoying console warning. Easiest way, use one of the
            <a href="https://favicon.io/" target="_blank">favicon.io</a>
            favicon generators, and they will not only render all
            the files required for it, but they'll also provide the
            markup for the headers, as well as a
            <code>site.webmanifest</code> file for android users to
            be able to create shortcuts on their homescreen of your
            website - just don't forget to update the name and
            short name values in that file before pushing.
        </p>

        <h2 id="sitemap">Sitemap</h2>
        <p>
            There are two main types of sitemap. The first is 
            html sitemaps, intended for users, but search engines
            can also crawl them to find links to all the pages on
            your site. The second is xml sitemaps, which you can
            submit directly to search engines, so they have an
            immediate directory of your sites urls.
        </p>
        <p>
            Creating a html sitemap isn't too difficult if you
            have already managed to code a static website, so
            I'll look at the xml sitemap, as there's a bit to
            learn with xml if you haven't used it much before.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            Note: If your site is only one page, you do not need any
            sitemaps.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sitemap xml file isn't too complicated, and is a
            good thing to look at before moving onto RSS feeds,
            which are similar but have a fair bit more going on
            to them. Let's take a look at the sitemap for this
            website, and then break it down:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-html"><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9"&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;
        &lt;loc&gt;https://aaronwattsdev.com/&lt;/loc&gt;
    &lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;
        &lt;loc&gt;https://aaronwattsdev.com/home/&lt;/loc&gt;
    &lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;
        &lt;loc&gt;https://aaronwattsdev.com/projects/gpicase/&lt;/loc&gt;
    &lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;
        &lt;loc&gt;https://aaronwattsdev.com/projects/kde-plasma-bigscreen/&lt;/loc&gt;
    &lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;
        &lt;loc&gt;https://aaronwattsdev.com/projects/media-keyboard/&lt;/loc&gt;
    &lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;
        &lt;loc&gt;https://aaronwattsdev.com/projects/pi5-desktop/&lt;/loc&gt;
    &lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;
        &lt;loc&gt;https://aaronwattsdev.com/projects/retropie-nespi-4/&lt;/loc&gt;
    &lt;/url&gt;
&lt;/urlset&gt;</code></pre>
    
        <p>
            This should all look a little familiar if you've ever
            played around with svg's in the browser, as it's the
            same type of markup. The first line is just stating
            which version of xml and encoding the document is using.
        </p>

<pre class="language-xml"><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>
            The next line is the opening tag for the root element,
            <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code>. It's what it sounds like, a set of
            url's.
        </p>

<pre class="language-xml"><code>&lt;urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9"&gt;
    &lt;!-- urls go here --&gt;
&lt;/urlset&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>
            Nested within the <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code> element are the
            <code>&lt;url&gt;</code> elements, one for each page in your
            website that you wish to be known to a search engines
            crawler. Nested within each <code>&lt;url&gt;</code>
            element, should be the information about each url.
            <code>&lt;loc&gt;</code> contains the url itself,
            and is the only tag that's required within the
            <code>&lt;url&gt;</code> tag,
            but you can check what other tags can be included by
            checking the protocol documenation at 
            <a href="https://sitemaps.org/protocol.html"
            target="_blank">sitemap.org</a>.
        </p>

<pre class="language-xml"><code>&lt;url&gt;
    &lt;loc&gt;https://aaronwattsdev.com/&lt;/loc&gt;
&lt;/url&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>
            A CMS would write these out for you, and doing them
            by hand can become a bit boring, and also prone to
            human error, so we will take a look at writing
            scripts to build these xml files for us shortly.
            But first, let's look at the rss feed.
        </p>

        <h2 id="feed">RSS Feed</h2>
        <p>
            So, the following xml file contains the bare minimum for
            an rss feed to function in most readers. The required elements
            are all there. We can add more for a far better experience,
            but already, it is quite a bit to write each time you want
            to add to the feed. Further, all the required information
            can be gathered from within our project in some way, so
            before we flesh this file out to be a better feed, we would
            be foolish not to get some kind of automation set up to do
            this for us.
        </p>
        <p>
            But first, let's have a quick look at what we have so far:
        </p>
<pre class="language-xml"><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;rss version="2.0"&gt;
    &lt;channel&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;AaronWattsDev Projects&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link&gt;https://aaronwattsdev.com/home&lt;/link&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;Projects in coding, raspberry pi, linux and more&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;Raspberry Pi 5 - Desktop Computer&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;link&gt;https://aaronwattsdev.com/projects/pi5-desktop&lt;/link&gt;
            &lt;description&gt;This is less of a guide, and more just an outline of how, and why, I'm doing it. As well as a review of how it's going. It's not here as clickbait, you might not want to do it yourself, but I'm here to say that it's working for me.&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;KDE Plasma Bigscreen - Raspberry Pi 4&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;link&gt;https://aaronwattsdev.com/projects/kde-plasma-bigscreen&lt;/link&gt;
            &lt;description&gt;I built this media centre at the start of 2024. There may be easier methods of installation by now. When I built this project, existing guides mentioned an installation image on KDE's bigscreen page, however, it doesn't seem to exist currently, except for a manjaro image, and I prefer to stick to Raspberry Pi's own debian OS when I can, especially that it ensures the best compatibility with things like cases and accessories.&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;

            &lt;description&gt;The Raspberry Pi 4, with Retroflag's NesPi 4 Case, running RetroPie is the ultimate retro gaming rig. Lower power consumption? Check. Light gun games? You got it. Great customisation options? Of course. Did you know you can even use a wiimote as the stylus for the Drastic Nintendo DS Emulator?? Did I hear someone say Wario Ware?&lt;/description&gt;

            &lt;description&gt;My keyboard doesn't include the media keys, so I built a macro keyboard to control the media on my desktop computer. It is plug'n'play and requires no configuration to work between different devices. The project can be easily tweaked to program macro's for work, steam games, and whatever else you can't be bothered to type out manually.&lt;/description&gt;

            &lt;description&gt;The GPi Case 2 with Raspberry Pi's Compute Module 4 is the ultimate portable gaming device. The case offers amazing functionality, and when combined with a CM4 and 64-bit Recalbox, there is little that can challenge it for a portable retro gaming experience.&lt;/description&gt;

        <p>
            So, ignoring the first line, that is the same as the
            sitemap xml file, we can see that the root element in
            the rss feed is the <code>&lt;rss&gt;</code> element.
            The rss version is specified as an attribute, it is
            using rss 2.0. Within that, is the nested 
            <code>&lt;channel&gt;</code> element. Inside of the
            <code>&lt;channel&gt;</code> element, we have the feed
            information: <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>,
            <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> and
            <code>&lt;description&gt;</code>. This all provides
            the rss aggregators with the information they need about
            the channel itself.
        </p>

    <pre class="language-xml"><code>&lt;rss version="2.0"&gt;
    &lt;channel&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;AaronWattsDev Projects&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link&gt;https://aaronwattsdev.com/home&lt;/link&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;Projects in coding, raspberry pi, linux and more&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;!-- rss items go here --&gt;
    &lt;/channel&gt;
&lt;/rss&gt;</code></pre>
    
        <p>
            Finally, we have the rss items themselves. These each
            consist of an <code>&lt;item&gt;</code> element, with a
            nested <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>,
            <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;description&gt;</code>
            element each. What's helpful about these elements, is the
            information they require are all available on this sites
            <a href="/home">home page</a>, where each project is listed
            with links and descriptions. This will come in handy in a
            when we automate the feed.

    &lt;description&gt;This is less of a guide, and more just an outline of how, and why, I'm doing it. As well as a review of how it's going. It's not here as clickbait, you might not want to do it yourself, but I'm here to say that it's working for me.&lt;/description&gt;

        <h2 id="automating">Automating the Boring Stuff</h2>

        <p>
            One of the main benefits of using a CMS, is that you
            don't have to do, or even think about, most of this
            stuff. Not only is ammending the sitemap and rss feed
            another job that can be time consuming, forgotten,
            or even done wrong, but it's also not necessary.
            Even without a CMS, we can make our own lives easier
            with a bit of messy hacking. First let's handle the
            easy one, which is the sitemap. But before we begin,
            it's worth mentioning that a sensible directory
            structure will help a lot with automation, and that
            what I write here isn't necessarily going to work for
            your own sites structure, so you will need to hack
            around with it yourself to get it working for you.
            I will talk about the structure I use and how it
            affects or benefits the scripts I'm writing for
            reference.
        </p>

        <h3>A Sitemap Generator in Python</h3>

        <p>
            So the sitemap is essentially just a set of links
            to each html page in the website. Easy, my site
            only has two folders containing any html files at
            all, that's the <code>root/</code> and
            <code>projects/</code> directories.
        </p>

<pre class="language-none"><code>/
index.html
home.html
projects/
    gpicase.html
    kde-plasma-bigscreen.html
    media-keyboard.html
    pi5-desktop.html
    retropie-nespi-4.html
</code></pre>

        <p>
            With this in mind, all we need to do, is build a
            <code>&lt;url&gt;</code> element for each file,
            append it to the root element, and then write it to
            a file. We can use the <code>os</code> module to
            probe our filesystem, and the
            <code>xml.etree.ElementTree</code> module parses
            and writes xml. Both are included in python3.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following snippet will build a root element,
            and then append a subelement to it, and fill out
            the text. We also have to register the xml
            namespace we will be using <em>before</em> we make
            the root element, and set the namespace on the root
            element after we have created it, not doing so
            will result in <code>ns0</code> inserting itself
            within all the following elements down the tree.
        </p>
<pre class="language-python"><code>import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

# create the root element and set namespace
ET.register_namespace('', 'http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9')
urlset = ET.Element('urlset')
urlset.set('xmlns', 'http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9')

# append a subelement to the root element
url = ET.SubElement(urlset, 'url')
loc = ET.SubElement(url, 'loc')
loc.text = 'https://aaronwattsdev.com/'</code></pre>

        <p>
            We are going to have to build a lot more url's,
            so that may as well be extracted out to a function.
            We will pass the file<em>path</em> to it as a
            parameter, and use it to build the url itself.
            We will also set the default path param to an empty
            string, for when we need to build the index url.
        </p>
<pre class="language-python"><code>def build_url(path=''):
    url = ET.SubElement(urlset, 'url')
    loc = ET.SubElement(url, 'loc')
    loc.text = f'{root_url}{path}'</code></pre>

        <p>
            I'm going to keep the script simple, and just
            call the two files in the root directory
            directly, as I don't expect these to change any
            time soon. But the projects directory is likely
            to have new files going into it regularly, so
            for that, I will use the <code>os</code> python
            module to iterate through these files, and
            call the build file function, passing the filename with
            the <code>.html</code> extension truncated off.
        </p>

<pre class="language-python"><code>build_url()
build_url('home/')

for filename in os.listdir('projects/'):
    build_url(f'{filename[:-5]}/')</code></pre>

        <p>
            Finally, we just need to declare the element
            tree, indent it for readability, and write it
            to <code>sitemap.xml</code>. We can define the
            xml version and encoding in the write function.
        </p>

<pre class="language-python"><code>tree = ET.ElementTree(urlset)
ET.indent(tree)
tree.write('sitemap.xml', xml_declaration='version', encoding='UTF-8')</code></pre>

        <p>
            A quick look at the finished script and you will
            see I have stored the base url as a string, to help
            in the build url function. It only gets used on the
            one line within the function, but it makes it easier
            to change later if we need to by declaring it at the
            start of the script
        </p>

<pre class="language-python"><code>import os
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

root_url = 'https://aaronwattsdev.com/'

def build_url(path=''):
    url = ET.SubElement(urlset, 'url')
    loc = ET.SubElement(url, 'loc')
    loc.text = f'{root_url}{path}'

ET.register_namespace('', 'http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9')
urlset = ET.Element('urlset')
urlset.set('xmlns', 'http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9')

build_url()
build_url('home/')

for filename in os.listdir('projects/'):
    build_url(f'{filename[:-5]}/')

tree = ET.ElementTree(urlset)
ET.indent(tree)
tree.write('sitemap.xml', xml_declaration='version', encoding='UTF-8')</code></pre>

        <h3>A Simple RSS Generator in Python</h3>

        <p>
            There is a bit more to do in this script. As well as
            url's for each page, we will need a title and a
            description for each project. Well, that all exists
            in <code>/home.html</code>, and we can use the
            python <code>bs4</code>, a.k.a. Beautiful Soup,
            module to read and parse the html file, and extract
            all the data we need.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            Beautiful Soup is not a built-in python module, and
            will need to be installed, along with a parser. For
            more information check the
            <a href="https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installing-beautiful-soup"
            target="_blank">documentation</a>.
        </p>
<pre class="language-python"><code>from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

with open('home.html') as f:
    txt = f.read()
    soup = BeautifulSoup(txt, 'lxml')

projects = soup.select('.project')

for project in projects:
    title = project.select_one('h2').text
    link = project.select_one('a')['href']
    description = project.select_one('.description').text</code></pre>

        <p>
            The next step is to build the xml. Which is
            essentially the same process as with the sitemap,
            however the elements are a little more complex
            for the rss elements.
        </p>

<pre class="language-python"><code>import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

        <h3>A Better RSS Feed</h3>

        <p>
            We have the basics now for a working RSS feed,
            but loaded up into an aggregator, it looks a little
            empty compared to other RSS feeds out there. There
            are a few tweaks we can make to the feed to improve
            it. By including the atom namespace and an
            <code>&lt;atom:link&gt;</code> element in the channel, we
            can increase the rss feed's compatibility with
            more aggregators. We can also use
            <code>&lt;enclosure&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;media&gt;</code>
            elements to include images in the rss feed. A
            <code>&lt;guid&gt;</code> element can help aggregators
            work out if it has already received an item or
            not. And some aggregators use the
            <code>&lt;category&gt;</code> element to categorise
            feeds.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are other elements you can include, such as
            dates for updates and published, but I am not yet
            including this information in articles, I may
            implement it in the near future. Check the
            rssboard <a href="https://www.rssboard.org/media-rss"
            target="_blank">media-rss documentation</a> for
            more quality-of-life elements around media.

&lt;/rss&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>
            My design choices and project structure have
            influenced how I have written the script to collect
            all the required information to build the individual
            rss items. For example, I don't have any image links
            on the page I am scraping on - I just didn't want
            the page to have to load an image for every article.
            However, I have only one image per article, and
            each image has the same filename as the html file
            it's associated with. So by knowing the page url,
            the script can easily decipher the image url that's
            associated with it.
        </p>

<pre class="language-none"><code>/

        kde-plasma-bigscreen.jpg</code></pre>

        <p>
            A different solution here could be to include a
            hidden element in each project on the home page
            that lists them, with innertext that defines
            an image url. Here is the final script for
            generating a more complex rss feed, there's
            a lot happening, but broken down, it's not too
            different from the simple rss script, it just
            has more jobs to do now:

            much more work than we've already done, be generated
            from the files in the <code>projects/</code>
            directory. Right now I haven't implemented published
            dates for each article, and so I unless I handle it
            another way, articles will become listed in alphabetical
            order, and I think I would prefer to have newest appear
            first. We could even strip away the repeated code from
            each project page, such as the headers, links and style
            tags, and have Beautiful Soup build the pages from
            very simple hmtl pages that only contain the article
            information, the way the Jekyll builds from markdown
            files, but as we are working directly in html, we would
            have far more control over CSS and JavaScript. Then, after
            that, I'm not really sure what a CMS could offer that we
            haven't already just done ourselves. These
            are things I hope to look at in the near future, but for
            now, I can feel my pigments fading and I would like to
            go out into the sunlight for a while, so let's start
            wrapping this up.

        <h2 id="adding-comments-section">Adding A Comments Section</h2>
        <p>
            This wasn't something that I was previously aware that
            you could do with static websites, and I'm not even sure
            what first brought my attention to it. But it turns out
            there are quite a few options here. There seems to an
            option or two that use github issues to serve the comments,
            which is actually pretty smart. But the one I chose to go
            with was <a href="https://cactus.chat/"
            target="_blank">Cactus Comments</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cactus Comments is free, and doesn't require users to
            sign in like the solutions based on github issues.
            It runs on <a href="https://matrix.org/"
            target="_blank">matrix</a>, which is a defederated chat and
            messaging service. And I'm a big fan of defederation.
            As it runs on matrix, you can use the
            <a href="https://element.io/"
            target="_blank">element</a> PC and mobile apps to get
            alerts of, reply to, and moderate comments (there is
            an arm 64-bit version for linux too, which is great now
            that I do all of my computing on my raspberry pi 5!).
        </p>
        <p>
            I won't explain how to get started, the documentation
            for cactus is pretty easy to follow. At first look you'll
            wonder if there's stuff missing from it, as it all seems
            too simple, but it really is as simple as it looks!
