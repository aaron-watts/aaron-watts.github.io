        <p id="intro">
            You don't always need a full stack. When all you need to
            do is show information, a static website is enough. And
            with Github Pages, it is possible to have a fully
            functioning website for free, just like this one! It could
            just be the perfect solution for your portfolio page.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, in 2024, static sites can do a bit more than just
            send information. This site, for example, has a 
            <a href="#comment-section">comment section</a> on each
            project page (scroll down and see for yourself). There's
            an oceans-worth of webdev lessons and tutorials out there,
            but not many really talk about getting the site up, and
            indexed. So instead of talking about how to code a website,
            I thought I'd go over some of the things I've learned in 
            building this website and getting it bing-ready, as well
            as some of the interesting things you can get working on
            static websites today.
        </p>

        <h2 id="cms">Why Not a CMS?</h2>
        <p>
            Good question. You can absolutely use a Content Management
            System. Github Pages even has one incorporated into it, 
            it's called
            <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>.
            But I had a very specific vision for my website. Story time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I bought my domain name a while ago. I had been learning
            web development, and thought I might like to do it
            professionally. And so, naturally I would need an online
            portfolio. Eventually, I changed my mind, and decided that
            I prefer to play with mono fonts as a hobby, so I scrapped
            that idea. But I kept the domain name, just in case I
            decided I might eventually want to do something with it.
            And I did, I'm doing it now, it's this site. Anyway, when
            I was learning all these amazing CSS and Javascript spells
            and incantations, two things would often happen. The first
            was that more
            code would lead to more bugs, and the other thing was that
            I was never satisified with a project. I would always want
            to improve or fix something, and nothing ever got finished.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then I came across a website, just some
            <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/" 
            target="_blank">motherfucking website</a>, and I realised
            then, that less is more. When I decided I wanted to build
            this website to log my projects, I decided I wanted it to
            follow those design principles (or lack there of). In
            doing very little, I wanted to acheive a responsive,
            hierarchical website that just worked everywhere, and
            loaded up <em>fast</em>. You don't get that with CMS's.
            And to that end, I use very little javascript on this site
            (even though I love javascript), it highlights my syntax,
            runs a filter feature on the home page, and runs the
            comments sections on these projects pages. I don't import
            fonts, and as much as possible is hosted in the website
            itself. The only external service is the comments because,
            well, static.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, to keep to those design principles, I've opted to do
            everything myself (and also because I enjoy coding).
            Although, that doesn't mean things have to be difficult
            either. After looking at the things you need to get done
            to pass the bing test, we will take a look at automating
            some of the tedious stuff with python scripts.
        </p>

        <h2 id="github-pages">Github Pages</h2>
        <p>
            So, assuming you've got a basic website built and ready
            to go, you will need somewhere to serve the files from.
            I'm not savvy enough to want to brave self hosting on
            a home server, so I opted for
            <a href="https://pages.github.com/"
            target="_blank">Github Pages</a>. 
            If you're here reading this, then chances are you either
            have a github account, or are familiar with the git CLI.
            Github Pages websites are free, though there are
            limitations to them, but for a portfolio page, a blog,
            or documentation it is ideal.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are 2 different types of github pages websites.
            The first is the user/organisation site. This will
            give you a url in the format
            <code>&lt;username&gt;.github.io</code>, which, in
            itself is pretty tidy as far as free url's go. You will 
            be able to use advanced DNS configuration with a DNS 
            provider such as namecheap if you go this route, meaning
            it will be much easier to set up with search engines.
            The second is a project site. Although trickier, it is
            still possible to set up a custom domain in this case, 
            and without advanced DNS configuration, setting up with
            search engines will involve adding meta tags into the
            site headers for verification.
        </p>

        <h2 id="custom-domain">Custom Domain Name</h2>
        <p>
            You don't need a custom domain name. But with a DNS
            provider, such as
            <a target="_blank" 
            href="https://www.namecheap.com/">namecheap</a>,
            you get the benefit of advnaced DNS configuration,
            making it far easier to set up SEO, using CNAME and
            txt records, instead of uglying up your code with
            unnecessary meta tags. Also, <code>&lt;yourname&gt;.com</code>
            looks far nicer, and more professional, than
            <code>&lt;yourname&gt;.github.io</code>. The process for getting
            custom domains set up for user and organisation
            pages is pretty thoroughly documented by gihtub
            <a 
                href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site"
                target="_blank"
            >here</a>. For project pages, there is a solution
            that worked for me over at Stack Overflow
            <a 
                href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/9123911"
                target="_blank"
            >here</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="bing">Getting Bing Ready</h2>
        <p>
            Okay, so Bing is not the only search engine. But
            out of Bing and Google, Bing is definitely the
            hard-arse parent that isn't goint to tolerate any
            slack from you. Google is quite lax, provided your
            url's are all correct and your site is verified.
            But Bing runs a number of tests and won't index
            if your site fails them. The only other remaining
            <em>pure search engines</em> remaining today,
            might be Yahoo and DuckDuckGo, but both of those
            pull indexes off of Bing, so through the hoops
            we jump. There may well be more issues than what
            I bring up here, but assuming you're starting
            with something like the emmet boilerplate, you
            shouldn't run in to too many more than I did.
        </p>
        <h3>H1's</h3>
        <p>
            They tried to tell you. You didn't listen.
            Semantics is important. But you kept following
            those CSS guru's on youtube like they were bitches
            on heat. Now all you know about web dev is how to
            nest spans in divs in spans in divs to make a
            sidemenu icon change shape when the menu is hidden.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bing wants to see a h1 on every page. Be smart and
            use it on the <em>main title</em> of the 
            <em>relevant content</em> of each page. I didn't
            really see the need for one on my
            <a href="/" target="_blank"
            >splash page</a>, but Bing flagged it, so I had to
            put one in and cancel the styling on it.
        </p>

        <h3>Alt-txt</h3>
        <p>
            Yes, semantics is important. And yes, I regularly
            forget to put the alt-txt on images. Oh, fine. I
            just don't bother, I remember and then decide I'm
            too lazy to do it. Anyway, Bing pulled me on it,
            and now I try to be a good web dev.
        </p>

        <h3>Meta Description</h3>
        <p>
            SEO has changed over the years, and search engines
            rely less on the meta tags in html headers than they
            used to. However, Bing still wants a meta desription
            tag, it won't index a page without one. You can throw
            in the meta keywords lists and all other bells and
            whistles if you wish, but just make sure the description
            is in their, as it seems to be the one Bing cares about.
        </p>

        <h3>Favicon</h3>
        <p>
            Technically, this wasn't really an obstacle to getting
            indexed, but it is rumoured that it can improve your
            ranking in search engines, and it also get's rid of that
            annoying console warning. Easiest way, use one of the
            <a href="https://favicon.io/" target="_blank">favicon.io</a>
            favicon generators, and they will not only render all
            the files required for it, but they'll also provide the
            markup for the headers, as well as a
            <code>site.webmanifest</code> file for android users to
            be able to create shortcuts on their homescreen of your
            website - just don't forget to update the name and
            short name values in that file before pushing.
        </p>

        <h2 id="sitemap">Sitemap</h2>
        <p>
            There are two main types of sitemap. The first is 
            html sitemaps, intended for users, but search engines
            can also crawl them to find links to all the pages on
            your site. The second is xml sitemaps, which you can
            submit directly to search engines, so they have an
            immediate directory of your sites urls.
        </p>
        <p>
            Creating a html sitemap isn't too difficult if you
            have already managed to code a static website, so
            I'll look at the xml sitemap, as there's a bit to
            learn with xml if you haven't used it much before.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            Note: If your site is only one page, you do not need any
            sitemaps.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sitemap xml file isn't too complicated, and is a
            good thing to look at before moving onto RSS feeds,
            which are similar but have a fair bit more going on
            to them. Let's take a look at the sitemap for this
            website, and then break it down:
        </p>
        <pre class="language-html"><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9"&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;
        &lt;loc&gt;https://aaronwattsdev.com/&lt;/loc&gt;
    &lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;
        &lt;loc&gt;https://aaronwattsdev.com/home/&lt;/loc&gt;
    &lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;
        &lt;loc&gt;https://aaronwattsdev.com/projects/gpicase/&lt;/loc&gt;
    &lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;
        &lt;loc&gt;https://aaronwattsdev.com/projects/kde-plasma-bigscreen/&lt;/loc&gt;
    &lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;
        &lt;loc&gt;https://aaronwattsdev.com/projects/media-keyboard/&lt;/loc&gt;
    &lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;
        &lt;loc&gt;https://aaronwattsdev.com/projects/pi5-desktop/&lt;/loc&gt;
    &lt;/url&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;
        &lt;loc&gt;https://aaronwattsdev.com/projects/retropie-nespi-4/&lt;/loc&gt;
    &lt;/url&gt;
&lt;/urlset&gt;</code></pre>
    
    <p>
        This should all look a little familiar if you've ever
        played around with svg's in the browser, as it's the
        same type of markup. The first line is just stating
        which version of xml and encoding the document is using.
    </p>

<pre class="language-xml"><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>
        The next line is the opening tag for the root element,
        <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code>. It's what it sounds like, a set of
        url's.
    </p>

<pre class="language-xml"><code>&lt;urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9"&gt;
    &lt;!-- urls go here --&gt;
&lt;/urlset&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>
        Nested within the <code>&lt;urlset&gt;</code> element are the
        <code>&lt;url&gt;</code> elements, one for each page in your
        website that you wish to be known to a search engines
        crawler. Nested within each <code>&lt;url&gt;</code>
        element, should be the information about each url.
        <code>&lt;loc&gt;</code> contains the url itself,
        and is the only tag that's required within the
        <code>&lt;url&gt;</code> tag,
        but you can check what other tags can be included by
        checking the protocol documenation at 
        <a href="https://sitemaps.org/protocol.html"
        target="_blank">sitemap.org</a>.
    </p>

<pre class="language-xml"><code>&lt;url&gt;
    &lt;loc&gt;https://aaronwattsdev.com/&lt;/loc&gt;
&lt;/url&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>
        A CMS would write these out for you, and doing them
        by hand can become a bit boring, and also prone to
        human error, so we will take a look at writing
        scripts to build these xml files for us shortly.
        But first, let's look at the rss feed.
    </p>

    <h2 id="feed">RSS Feed</h2>
    <p>
        So, the following xml file contains the bare minimum for
        an rss feed to function in most readers. The required elements
        are all there. We can add more for a far better experience,
        but already, it is quite a bit to write each time you want
        to add to the feed. Further, all the required information
        can be gathered from within our project in some way, so
        before we flesh this file out to be a better feed, we would
        be foolish not to get some kind of automation set up to do
        this for us.
    </p>
    <p>
        But first, let's have a quick look at what we have so far:
    </p>
<pre class="language-xml"><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;rss version="2.0"&gt;
    &lt;channel&gt;

        &lt;description&gt;Projects in coding, raspberry pi, linux and more&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;Raspberry Pi 5 - Desktop Computer&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;link&gt;https://aaronwattsdev.com/projects/pi5-desktop&lt;/link&gt;
            &lt;description&gt;This is less of a guide, and more just an outline of how, and why, I'm doing it. As well as a review of how it's going. It's not here as clickbait, you might not want to do it yourself, but I'm here to say that it's working for me.&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;KDE Plasma Bigscreen - Raspberry Pi 4&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;link&gt;https://aaronwattsdev.com/projects/kde-plasma-bigscreen&lt;/link&gt;
            &lt;description&gt;I built this media centre at the start of 2024. There may be easier methods of installation by now. When I built this project, existing guides mentioned an installation image on KDE's bigscreen page, however, it doesn't seem to exist currently, except for a manjaro image, and I prefer to stick to Raspberry Pi's own debian OS when I can, especially that it ensures the best compatibility with things like cases and accessories.&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
        &lt;item&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;RetroPie - RetroFlag NesPi 4 Case&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;link&gt;https://aaronwattsdev.com/projects/retropie-nespi-4&lt;/link&gt;
            &lt;description&gt;The Raspberry Pi 4, with Retroflag's NesPi 4 Case, running RetroPie is the ultimate retro gaming rig. Lower power consumption? Check. Light gun games? You got it. Great customisation options? Of course. Did you know you can even use a wiimote as the stylus for the Drastic Nintendo DS Emulator?? Did I hear someone say Wario Ware?&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;

            &lt;description&gt;My keyboard doesn't include the media keys, so I built a macro keyboard to control the media on my desktop computer. It is plug'n'play and requires no configuration to work between different devices. The project can be easily tweaked to program macro's for work, steam games, and whatever else you can't be bothered to type out manually.&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;

            &lt;title&gt;GPi Case 2 - Compute Module 4&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;link&gt;https://aaronwattsdev.com/projects/gpicase&lt;/link&gt;
            &lt;description&gt;The GPi Case 2 with Raspberry Pi's Compute Module 4 is the ultimate portable gaming device. The case offers amazing functionality, and when combined with a CM4 and 64-bit Recalbox, there is little that can challenge it for a portable retro gaming experience.&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;/item&gt;
