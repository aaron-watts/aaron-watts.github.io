        alt="A Rspberry Pi 4b in an Argon One M.2. Sata case, powered
        on and plugged into a TV that is on the KDE Plasma Bigscreen
        home screen, with a Debian logo wallpaper.">
        <p id="intro">
            I built this media centre at the start of 2024. There may
            be easier methods of installation by now. When I built this
            project, existing guides mentioned an installation image
            on KDE's bigscreen page, however, it doesn't seem to exist
            currently, except for a manjaro image, and I prefer to stick
            to Raspberry Pi's own debian OS when I can, especially that
            it ensures the best compatibility with things like cases and
            accessories.
        </p>
        <p>
            Feel free to change and tweak what you like to what suits you,
            however, things you will need are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Raspberry Pi 4b (2GB RAM+)</li>
            <li>USB storage device</li>
            <li>Some kind of cooling system</li>
            <li>Something to do buttons on</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I used a pi 4b 4GB RAM model myself for this project, as
            it was the unit that my pi 5 replaced on my work desk.
            While testing the system, I never pushed the RAM much past
            1.7GB, so I think anything 2GB or higher will run okay.
            Anything lower than a pi 4 is going to struggle rendering
            KDE - the pi 4 needs an overclock to get everything running
            smoothly, hence the required cooling system. I used the
            Argon One case with the sata M.2. drive expansion, however
            I got similar results with preformance running from a USB
            3.0 thumb drive. Plasma bigscreen, while offering limited
            support for remote controls, doesn't come with apps, so we
            will be using web-apps through the chromium browser, so
            some kind of keyboard is advised - KDE Connect on an android
            phone works great here, or you can get mini wireless keyboards
            with built in track pads on amazon.
        </p>

        <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
            Start by flashing the latest
            <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/" target="_blank">
                64-bit Raspberry Pi OS Lite</a>
            to a usb device. You may need to
            <a href="https://www.raspberrystreet.com/learn/how-to-boot-raspberrypi-from-usb-ssd" target="_blank">
                update the EEPROM</a>
            if you haven't already in order to boot from USB. Take
            advantage of rpi imager settings here to enable SSH and
            change hostname so you can tell it apart from the 6 other
            pi's you have running around your house. If using a
            different imaer then don't forget to include the SSH
            file as you may need it on the next step.
        </p>
        <p>
            After initial boot, the screen may black out, using the
            same image I had this happen with the USB SSB, but not
            the USB thumb drive - your guess is as good as mine..
            If it blacks out then ssh in and vi or nano into
            <code>/boot/firmware/config.txt</code> and comment out
            and add the following lines:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-none">#dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d
dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d</code></pre>
        <p>
            Now that the screen is working you can log into the
            session, and make the usual prayer
            <code>sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y</code>
            followed by a <code>sudo reboot</code> for luck.
        </p>

        <h2 id="installing-kde-plasma">Installing KDE Plasma</h2>
        <p>
            Next we need to istall KDE Plasma; I ooriginally went
            for <code>kde-plasma-desktop</code> as its the lighter
            install, but it kept hanging at boot, you ight have more
            luck, but expect to start again if it fails.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-none">sudo apt install kde-standard</code></pre>
        <p>
            After that, another reboot for luck. Then we need to
            activate the sddm login manager service, and tell
            raspi OS that we want to boot into GUI on the next
            boot:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-none">sudo systemctl enable sddm
sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target</code></pre>
        <p>
            And reboot again. It should now boot into Plasma,
            and the first thing you should do is disable all the
            destkop effects; older pi KDE Plasma guides suggest
            to disable the compositor, but the session defaults
            to wayland unless you tell it not, and wayland can't
            run without the compositor - I've noticed no major
            differences between X11 and wayland myself in this
            use case (don't believe the hype).
        </p>
        <aside>
            Note: disabling compositor in X causes screen tearing
            on video playback, so even if you choose to use X,
            leave the compositor on and just disable effects.
        </aside>
        <p>
            If you're also using an Argon One case, now is the
            time to open up konsole and install the power and
            fan control:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-none">curl https://download.argon40.com/argon1.sh | bash</code></pre>

        <h2 id="setting-up-plasma-bigscreen">Setting Up Plasma Bigscreen</h2>
        <p>
            Now the effects are disabled, and if you have your
            cooling set up, now is a good time to overclock,
            so back into <code>/boot/firmware/config.txt</code>.
            I just went with the following:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-none"># Overclock
over_voltage=6
arm_freq=2000
gpu_freq=700</code></pre>
        <p>
            Next we can install the other bits we need:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-none">sudo apt install chromium-browser rpi-chromium-mods plasma-bigscreen</code></pre>
        <p>
            If you want to watch DRM services like netflix you
            need another package that's not included in lite:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-none">sudo apt install libwidevinecdm0</code></pre>
        <p>
            KDE connect and an android phone make the perfect
            remote control, connect should already be included
            in the KDE install. But firewall suggested, with
            KDE connect and SSH rules:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-none">sudo apt install ufw
sudo ufw allow 1714:1764/upd
sudo ufw allow 1714:1764/tcp
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
sudo ufw enable</code></pre>
        <p>
            Next open chromium, add the extensions you want,
            and <em>"install"</em> your <em>"web apps"</em>.
        </p>
        <aside>
            Note: skip the splash screen - instead of installing
            web app when your on <u>questionable.com</u>, go to
            <u>questionable.com/home</u> and install from there.
        </aside>
        <aside>

            <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ublock-origin" target="_blank">uBlock Origin</a> and
            <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/privacy-badger" target="_blank">Privacy Badger</a> highly
            recommended!
        </aside>
        <aside>
            Update: with the introduction of Web Manifest V3 to
            Chromium based browsers, you may prefer to set your
            web apps to run through Firefox. Firefox for desktop
            doesn't support this natively, but there is a guide on
            how to set this up
            <a href="/guides/firefox-web-apps">here</a>.
        </aside>
        <p>
            Now open up KDE settings again, select
            <em>Startup and Shutdown > Login Screen (SDDM)</em>,
            and then click the behaviour button at the bottom and
            set plasma to log in automatically and change the session
            to bigscreen, enter your password to confirm, and it
            should prompt you to set a password for the keychain.
            I set a blank password because I want other people to
            be able to use the TV. Also disbale power saving, or
            at least getting sent back to the login screen after
            sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
            Done! Reboot and enjoy!
        </p>

        <h2 id="controls">Controls</h2>

        <h3>KDE Connect</h3>
        <p>
            By far the best option if you have an android phone or
            tablet lying around. KDE Connect for android is available
            in the standard
            <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.kde.kdeconnect_tp/" target="_blank">F-Droid repository</a>. The
            app includes
            a big screen feature, but you can get most of what you need
            done using the remote input feature.
        </p>
        <aside>
            As a side, <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/juloo.keyboard2/" target="_blank">Unexpected
                Keyboard</a> is a configurable
            keyboard for android that includes all the keys you might
            need to use the terminal.
        </aside>

        <h3>Mini Wireless Keyboard with Touchpad</h3>
        <p>
            The
            <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01G6XGLQQ" target="_blank">Rii K01X1 2.4GHz Mini Wireless
                Keyboard
                with Touchpad Remote Control</a> is the perfect companion
            for interacting with Plasma Bigscreen. However the range
            doesn't appear to be very long, especially on the Argon
            One case where the receiver plugged in at the back due to the
            Argon remote interacting with the front of the case.
            However this can be easily remedied with a short
            <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09LYRRQ91" target="_blank">USB extension cable</a>
            to point the receiver in the correct
            direction.
        </p>

        <h3>Argon IR Remote</h3>
        <p>
            As I previously mentioned, I am using an Argon One case,
            which is great as I get to use the Argon IR remote control.
            However, the debian version of Plasma Bigscreen doesn't
            have a working option to configure remotes as yet, so the
            remote is somewhat useless for now - except for the power
            button that is. And I love being able to power my pi on
            and off without leaving my sofa and walking the few feet
            required to do it manually. If you are using an Argon One
            case, the setup script should get everything installed for
            you, and then you simply need to type <code>argonone-ir</code>
            into the terminal to get it set up.
        </p>

        <h2 id="some-optional-polish">Some Optional Polish</h2>
        <h3>Window Decorations</h3>
        <p>
            Plasma Bigscreen is designed to work one window at a time,
            so if you minus a window without a keyboard, then you've
            essentially lost it for good. In settings you can remove
            the titlebar buttons for max/min and hide, and just leave
            the one to close the window with.
        </p>

        <h3>Splashscreen</h3>
        <p>
            In KDE settings change the splash screen from the default
            KDE one to the Plasma Bigscreen one, so that while you wait
            for your smart TV to boot up, you can relish in your
            accomplishment of having the most obscure smart TV out of
            everyone you know.
        </p>

        <h3>XScreensaver</h3>
        <aside>
            Note: It looks like this version of Bigscreen doesn't cooperate
            with XScreensaver very well. I've encountered 2 issues so far:
            firstly: the login scripts don't load up, and secondly:
            if the login scripts load up, then XScreensaver gets called
            after "inactivity" when watching content in fullscreen mode,
            which shouldn't happen. This, however, worked fine when using
            an X86 device with arch linux and the newer version of
            Bigscreen.
        </aside>
        <p>
            XScreensaver has a pretty cool analog tv effect screensaver
            that will cycle through images in a folder and display them
            with various tv static effects:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-none">sudo apt install xscreensaver xscreensaver-data-extra</code></pre>

        <h2 id="not-quite-full-screen">Not Quite Full Screen</h2>
        <p>
            KDE's window management isn't quite perfect, and full screen
            often falls short by 1 pixel on the right and bottom borders
            (despite any window rules you might add). This can be an
            irritant when a bright wallpaper sits behind whatever you're
            watching. The easiest fix is to set a dark-edged wallpaper.
            The newer bigscreen lets you use kde settings which is nice
            as you can set the wallpaper to plain colour black, but in
            the debian version you have to use the built in wallpaper
            settings app found in the bigscreen settings menu on the
            home screen. It will only show you the wallpapers that are
            installed, so download your dark wallpaper, then move it to
            the wallpaper folder and then it will show up in the wallpaper
            changer application:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-none">sudo mv ~/Downloads/&lt;wallpaper&gt; /usr/share/wallpaper/</code></pre>
