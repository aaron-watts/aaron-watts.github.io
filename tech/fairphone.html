        <p id="intro">
            Fairphone, based in Netherlands, brings something
            back to smartphones that most people don't even
            realise is missing. Their approach promotes user
            ownership of a device, and longevity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Smartphones are amazing. The Nokia 3210 was released
            the year I started senior school. If you had told me
            back then that in less than a decade, people would be
            walking around with computers in their pockets I would
            not have beleived it. But I feel as though there is a
            lot wrong with smartphones today. In this article I
            will talk about some of the issues I have with todays
            smartphones and how the <a href="https://www.fairphone.com/"
            target="_blank">Fairphone</a> tackles some of those
            issues.
        </p>

        <h2 id="longevity">Longevity</h2>
        <p>
            One big issue I have not just with smartphones, but
            with most tech nowadays, is that it's all made to be
            so <em>disposable</em>. Very often, a device can be
            operational, but it's manufacturer stops giving it
            updates, or the relatively simple apps that it uses
            insists on adding more and more bloat until the
            device can't help but stagger. This results in a lot
            of otherwise good devices making their way to landfill.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, I have to be careful with what I say here, as
            I don't want to oversell or misinform. Fairphones are
            designed to last. However, the Fairphone 4 has just
            been discontinued, after being released in 2021.
            They were unable to support Android 14 on the hardware,
            and it looks like the product has been shelved a
            little early as a result. However, they say they will
            continue to sell spare parts until 2028, and will
            provide software until 2026, with a hope of extending
            to 2028. This means the phone will have had an entire
            shelf life of either 5 or 7 years. That's 1 year less,
            or one more, than a typical Samsung depending on which
            it ends up being. With this in mind, it is clear they
            are trying to hold true to their goals of longevity,
            and hopefully they are gaining knowledge with each
            release. The Fairphone 5 is set to receive security
            updates until 2031, which, unless it also encounters
            an issue along the way, should see it supported for
            8 years. The Fairphone 4 was the companies first
            entirely modular phone, so really this should be
            considered the first of this generation of fairphones.
        </p>

        <h2 id="repair">Repair</h2>
        <p>
            Another huge irk I have with smartphones, is how
            costly it is to repair. They need to be repaired
            in shop, and it's not cheap. Fairphones are 
            modular and easily repaired at home. Ifixit
            rate the Fairphone 4 and 5 as
            <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Fairphone_5"
            target="_blank">10/10</a> for repairability.
        </p>

        <h2 id="ownership">Ownership</h2>
        <p>
            You can make phones more affordable by entering
            into a contract deal, which normally gives you
            better value for money on data, minutes and
            repairs. But you are also now locked in to a
            monthly payment. These also come with strict
            limitations on what you are allowed to do with
            your phone, void the contract and lose the perks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fairphone provide instructions on unlocking the
            bootloaders of their phones, so you can put
            your own operating system on it. They
            <em>want</em> you to be able to do this!
            They are also the device of choice for
            <a href="https://murena.com/"
            target="_blank">Murena</a>, a smartphone and
            cloud provider that promotes itself as privacy
            friendly while removing as much of Google from
            the Android operating system as it reasonably
            can.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default Fairphones ship with stock Android.
            Android as an operating system offers the user
            far more control than iOS, however, the big mobile
            companies such as Samsung ship their own
            <em>locked down</em> versions of the Android
            operating system that take away some of the control
            of the end user. On a Fairphone, if you don't like
            an uninstallable app, just disable it. You'd be
            surprised at what is included in Android that is
            actually not essential. This has the welcome side
            effect of <em>massively</em> reducing your data
            usage, so pay-and-go deals suddenly look far
            more appealing again.
        </p>
        <aside>
            TIP: another way to reduce data usage in Android
            is to change your default keyboard - GBoard connects
            to the internet for it's auto suggest and complete
            features. You can also disable it's data access in
            the app section in Android settings.
