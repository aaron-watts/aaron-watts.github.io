            Fairphone, based in Netherlands, brings something
            back to smartphones that most people don't even
            realise is missing. Their approach aims to promote
            user ownership of a device, and longevity.
        </p>
        <p>
            While they may not necessarily be hitting their mark
            in terms of longevity <em>just yet</em> (the Fairphone 4 won't
            really have had a much longer lifespan than most other
            Android devices when it reaches the current proposed EOL),
            <a href="https://www.fairphone.com/en"
            target="_blank">Fairphone</a> are certainly achieving their
            goals with regard to user ownership. They issue instructions
            on how to unlock the bootloader on their phones, and they
            have made it incredibly easy to self repair with their modular
            design.
        </p>
        <p>
            My biggest gripe about smartphones, is that it costs a
            fortune to fix if you break it. I don't like contracts, I
            try to steer clear of the subscription society that has
            become ubiquitous nowadays, so phone repair can get a little
            pricey. After breaking the screen on my Samsung a second
            time, I realised I was beginning to get close to the price
            for an entirely new handset if I took it in to get it fixed
            again. So I didn't. I got a Fairphone 4, which has a modular
            design, which means I could repair a screen at home for
            only £70.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Fairphone_4"
            target="_blank">Ifixit</a> have given the Fairphone 4 a
            repairability score of 10/10. Fairphone are still selling
            replacement parts for the Fairphone 3 and even 2 in their
            parts store. Hopefully, with a little more experience
            they can get the shelf life of their handsets to where
            they want them to be.
