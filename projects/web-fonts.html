            If you've ever used an older or lower spec device, or had
            a slow connection on a public wifi network, you
            may have noticed the fonts on a web page get loaded after
            the content and layout. Most of the time this is
            virtually unnoticable, but once you've seen it, as with
            most things traumatic, it is hard to unsee it. But there are
            a few steps we can take to mitigate this from happening.
        </p>

            I feel like fonts are something that get overlooked when
            learning web development, and also when teaching it.
            Budding web developers tend to be taught how to import a
            chosen font from a CDN service such as google fonts, and
            that tends to be the extent of fonts within the subject.
            I prefer to avoid external services wherever I can, as
            even the most reliable service can fail on occasion,
            which I've learned from experience.
        </p>

        <h2 id="local">Local Font Stack</h2>
        <p>
            Typically, I prefer to go with system fonts whenever I
            can. This website, for example, only sets fonts to
            <code>sans-serif</code> or <code>monospace</code>,
            and will just let the
            browser choose it's favourite if the user hasn't set
            their own preferences. <a href="https://prismjs.com/"
            target="_blank">Prism JS</a>, which I use for my
            code snippets, sets a sensible font stack, and looks
            for fonts installed locally on the users machine - it
            allows for some more thoughtful design without relying
            on http requests for fonts.
        </p>
        <pre class="language-css"><code>font-family: 
    Consolas,
    Monaco,
    'Andale Mono',
    'Ubuntu Mono',
    monospace;</code></pre>
        <p>
            If a local font stack is the way you want to go, then I
            highly suggest taking a look at <a href="https://simplecss.org/"
            target="_blank">Simple CSS</a>, a simple CSS framework
            that is intended as a starting point rather than a solution.
            I haven't used Simple CSS in any projects yet that are
            big enough to warrant including the entire (albeit, very
            small) file, but it is still quite handy to even just
            cherry pick from for smaller projects. For example it
            has a very sensible local font stack.
        </p>
        <pre class="language-css"><code>:root {
    /* Set sans-serif & mono fonts */
    --sans-font: 
        -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Avenir Next", Avenir,
        "Nimbus Sans L", Roboto, "Noto Sans", "Segoe UI", Arial, Helvetica,
        "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif;
    --mono-font: 
        Consolas, Menlo, Monaco, "Andale Mono", "Ubuntu Mono", monospace;
}</code></pre>

        <p>
            Sometimes you need a specific font, and don't want to
            rely on a local stack. For example, I work in a Youth
            Centre, and we often use the <a href="https://opendyslexic.org/"
            target="_blank">OpenDyslexic</a> font, which is designed
            to be easier to read for those with dyslexia - I am
            pleased to see this font being adopted elsewhere, such
            as the Rakuten Kobo eBook readers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every external service that your website connects to is
            a potential point for things to break. Fonts is not
            something I feel that should be fetched from elsewhere
            on the web. Furthermore, and this one is kinda big: in
            the EU at least, it's considered a breach of GDPR to
            import fonts from Google!
            Thankfully, Google Fonts are open source, and can be
            downloaded for self hosting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fonts typically download as TTF format files. TTF, or
            True Type Fonts, are typically what we would use to
            install a font on an operating system. They will include
            binary information required to render the fonts. While
            we can use TTF's in a web environment, they are bloated
            with unecessary data that a web browser doesn't need in
            order to render the fonts. For web fonts, we have WOFF
            and WOFF2 formats (the Web Open Font Format). The files
            are much smaller, are compressed, and only include
            necessary information. Good practise would be to use
            WOFF2, and include WOFF as a fallback. WOFF2 is currently
            well supported across all browsers (except some older
            versions of safari), so I personally don't worry about
            WOFF, but with the insight gained here, it shouldn't be
            too difficult to figure out how to support WOFF in your
            own projects.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            Safari is the new Internet Explorer
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            There are online font converters, but we are developers
            and we work in the terminal. Google offer a
            <a href="https://github.com/google/woff2"
            target="_blank">WOFF2 converter</a> that is easy to
            install and simple to use. After folling the install
            instructions, you can move the binaries to have global
            access to them within your system - just remember to
            restart your desktop session before calling them globally.
        </p>
        <pre class="language-none"><code>cp woff2_compress woff2_decompress ~/.local/bin/</code></pre>
        <p>
            After converting your fonts to WOFF2, you can now include
            the files in your project.
        </p>
        <pre class="language-none"><code>assets/
    fonts/
        OpenDyslexic3-Regular.woff2
index.html</code></pre>
        <p>
            In your CSS file, you simply need to create a
            <code>@font-face</code> rule to pull the font into
            your stylesheet. After that, you will be able to
            use the font with whatever you named it as in the
            <code>font-family</code> attribute of the
            <code>@font-face</code> rule.
        </p>
        <pre class="language-css"><code>@font-face {
    font-family: 'OpenDyslexic';
    src: url('/assets/fonts/OpenDyslexic3-Regular.woff2') format('woff2');
}

body {
    font-family: 'OpenDyslexic';
}</code></pre>
        
        <h2 id="preloading">Preloading Fonts</h2>
        <p>
            Wether you're fetching or self hosting a font, if it's
            not installed locally on the machine that is viewing
            your web page, it will need to be fetched. You would
            assume, that if it is within the stylesheet, the font
            would be applied when the styling rules are applied
            to the document. For reasons that I am not smart enough
            to understand, this is not the case. I haven't looked
            into it too much, but the web browser doesn't consider
            fonts a high priority, so it doesn't rush on this
            particular request. Even if we are self-hosting, the
            font still needs to be called from it's url, and this
            can cause some clumsy looking loading on weaker machines
            and slow internet connections.
        </p>
        <p>
            To mitigate this, we can simply preload the fonts
            within the html file. This will prevent the web browser
            from rendering any text to the DOM until the font
            becomes available. This means the content in the page
            takes a (very brief) moment longer to load, but it also
            means that it doesn't load in serif before changing to
            the correct font. Before your CSS, simply include another 
            <code>link</code>
            element with the relationship, or <code>rel</code>,
            attribute set to preload.
            We also need to set the <code>as</code> and <code>type</code>
            attributes, and also include the <code>crossorigin</code>
            attribute.
        </p>
        <pre class="language-html"><code>&lt;link rel="preload" href="/assets/fonts/OpenDyslexic3-Regular.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin /&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/styles/style.css"&gt;</code></pre>
        <aside>
            NOTE: The crossorigin attribute <em>must</em> be included
            even if the fonts url is locally hosted due to the way
            more modern resource types are fetched by the browser.
