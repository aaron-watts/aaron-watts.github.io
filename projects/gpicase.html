        <p id="intro">
            The GPi Case 2 with Raspberry Pi's Compute Module 4 is the
            ultimate portable gaming device. The case offers amazing
            functionality, and when combined with a CM4 and 64-bit
            Recalbox, there is little that can challenge it for a
            portable retro gaming experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this project, I went with a Compute Module 4, with 32Gb
            eMMC storage, and 4Gb RAM. I also went with no wireless, as
            this is my portable gaming device, and I don't require any
            online functionality for it. If you've read my NesPi-4 guide,
            you will know that I prefer RetroPie as my emulationstation
            frontend, but for this project I went with Recalbox instead.
            The biggest issue I've had with Recalbox in my Nespi-4 case,
            was that some updates would break the operating system
            sligthly. The web UI where you upload your games would stop
            working, and the shutdown option would disappear from the
            start menu. But as I don't really run this device online,
            the WebUI isn't as much of an issue, and the safe shutdown
            script for the GPi Case 2 means that the missing option
            isn't really an issue either. Although, I haven't really
            encountered the same glitches when updating Recalbox on this
            device. Recalbox also has a few features that let it pair
            extremely well to the GPi Case 2. It is 64-bit, which helps
            a lot with performance - I haven't overclocked it, as there
            is no cooling inside the case, but I still get great
            performance when emulating PSX, and it runs Mr. Driller
            and Volgar the Viking well on the Dreamcast - I haven't
            tried any games more taxing than those though, as it a
            battery powered device, and working it too hard is going
            to drain it faster. Recalbox is quite opinionated as far
            as emulationstation station frontends go, and to my
            knowledge, there is no way to add new emulators to it,
            although it does come prepacked with a more than reasonable
            collection of emulators, as well as lots of homebrew game
            ROMs, which is a very nice touch!
        </p>

        <h2 id="setting-up">Setting Up</h2>
        <p class="note">
            Note: I use Linux computers only, so these instructions
            might not be of use to you if you are using Windows or
            Mac OS.
        </p>
        <p>
            First you will need to flash Recalbox to the eMMC storage
            on the compute module 4. Either use the image provided in
            the Raspberry Pi Imager (Recalbox - Raspberry Pi 4 / 400
            (64 bits)), or download the image from
            <a 
                href="https://www.recalbox.com/download/stable/handheld/gpicase2/alternative/"
                target="_blank"
            >Recalbox</a> and install using your software of choice.
            To install directly onto the CM4's flash storage, we will
            need a piece of software that overrides the boot method
            on the CM4, and registers the device instead, as a storage
            device.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, we will need to check that
            <code>libusb-1.0-0-dev</code> is installed on your computer
            that you will be using to flash the CM4. Check using:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-none">apt list --installed | grep libusb</code></pre>
        <p>
            <code>libusb-1.0-0-dev</code> should be in the list. If it's
            not, then install it using:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-none">sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev</code></pre>
        <p>
            Next, we need to clone the
            <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot"
            target="_blank">Raspberry Pi USB Boot</a> repository.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-none">git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot</code></pre>
        <p>
            Next we need to build the software:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-none">cd usbboot
make</code></pre>
        <p>
            Now we can run the software:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-none">sudo ./rpiboot</code></pre>
        <p>
            Now, plug the GPiCase 2, with compute module 4 board
            installed, into your PC while the usbboot software is
            still running. You need to use the micro USB socket on
            the back of the case, under the cartridge style cover.
            Now power on the GPi Case 2, and the computer will now
            recognise the CM4 as a storage device. You can install
            the image just as you would an SD card.
        </p>

        <h2 id="bios">BIOS's</h2>
        <p>
            You can get a full set of the RetroPie BIOS's at
            <a href="https://github.com/archtaurus/RetroPieBIOS"
            target="_blank">this repo</a> (if you need help getting
            BIOS's from it, have a look at my
            <a href="/projects/retropie-nespi-4#bios"
            >NesPi-4 guide</a> for instructions).
            I haven't checked every single one,
            but they should cover most of what you'll need for
            Recalbox. Check where to load each BIOS in the
            <a href="https://wiki.recalbox.com/en/emulators/consoles/playstation-1/libretro-mednafen_psx"
            target="_blank"
            >RecalBox Documentation</a>. Use the installation
            instructions described in the next section about ROMs
            to install BIOS's onto the device.
        </p>

        <h2 id="roms">Adding ROMs</h2>
        <p>
            I'm not going to tell you where to get copies of ROMs
            you already own physical copies of, but if you need
            help with it, take a look at the
            <a href="/projects/retropie-nespi-4#games"
            >Getting Games</a> section in the Nespi-4 guide.
            To load the ROMs to CM4, you will need to run the
            <code>usbboot</code> software again, as with the
            installation. Games will need to be loaded onto
            the <em>Share</em> partition, check out the
            <a href="https://wiki.recalbox.com/en/emulators/consoles/playstation-1/libretro-mednafen_psx"
            target="_blank">RecalBox docs</a> for the correct
            location and formats of ROMs for specific emulators.
        </p>

        <h2 id="tweaks">Tweaks and Polish</h2>
        <h3>Theme</h3>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://github.com/SamYStudiO/es-theme-next-pixel"
            target="_blank">Next Pixel</a> theme is great for the small
            LCD screen on the GPiCase. It looks great and the font sizes
            are large enough to be readable. To install just clone the repo
            to your computer, then drop the folder into the
            <code>recalbox/themes</code> folder on the CM4 device.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-none">git clone https://github.com/SamYStudiO/es-theme-next-pixel.git</code></pre>
        <p>
            Then, from the Recalbox start menu, select <em>UI Settings
            &gt; Theme &gt; Theme Set</em>, and select the
            <em>ES-THEME-NEXT-PIXEL-V2-4X4-240P</em> theme from the menu.
            I also like to set the <em>On-Screen Help</em> to off, as
            the font is so small, and it's not hard to memorise the few
            UI controls.
        </p>
        <h3>Other Polish</h3>
        <p>
            In the <em>UI Settings > Popup Settings</em> menu, I set
            <em>Help Popup Duration</em> to 1 second, and
            <em>Music Popup Duration</em> to 0 seconds to hide music
            popups.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recalbox menu controls default to a PSX style layout,
            but as we have a Nintendo style layout, you can also set
            <em>Swap Validate/Cancel Buttons</em> in the UI settings
            to <em>On</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <em>Start</em> and <em>Home</em> buttons are incredibly
            close together on the GPiCase 2, and if your thumbs are
            as large as mine, it can be easy to accidentally hit
            both buttons at once, which happens to be the
            <em>Exit</em> hotkey. In <em>Game Settings</em>, we can
            set <em>Press Twice To Quit Game</em> to <em>On</em>, this
            will show a popup and require a second press to quit the
            game - a real frustration saver!
        </p>
        <p>
            To use the scraper, you will need an internet connection.
            I've found that the easiest way to achieve this, is to plug
            your phone into the USB-C port at the bottom, using a USB
            to USB-C adaptor, and use your phones USB hotspot tethering.
