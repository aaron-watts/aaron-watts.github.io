            I didn't intend to write an article about Watchy, as I
            only bought it to satisfy my nerd fetish. But after the
            trouble I had getting it to work, I thought I might write
            a short guide to assist anyone who might run into some of
            the same issues I did.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://watchy.sqfmi.com/" 
            target="_blank">Watchy</a>, by SQFMI, is an awesome
            gadget. In short it's a programmable watch, that you
            assemble yourself, with added wifi and accelerometer.
            It doesn't necessarily connect to your phone, so it's
            not a <em>smart</em> watch <em>per se</em>, but it is a
            clever watch. But, and it's a big but, the documentation
            is somewhat lacking. Unless you end up with the V3 watchy,
            the little documentation there is, is utterly useless.
        </p>
        <p>
            I bought mine from the <a href="https://thepihut.com"
            target="_blank">The Pi Hut</a>, which, according to the
            description on their site is a V2. If you end up with
            anything less than a V3, don't even bother with the
            <a href="https://watchy.sqfmi.com/docs/getting-started/"
            target="_blank">documentation</a> beyond the initial
            assembly, because it won't work.
        </p>

        <h2 id="signs">First Signs Something Is Wrong</h2>
        <p>
            So after assembly, and following the documentation to a
            tee, I tried the first seemingly obvious and easy thing
            to customising my watchy; I tried to change the watch
            face using one of the provided examples in the Arduino
            IDE. First I got an error that told me that my device
            was <em>ESP32</em> and not <em>ESP32-S3</em>. The error
            killed the operation. So, perhaps foolishly, seeing there
            wasn't really a solution offered within the docs, I did
            what that error told me, and switched boards in the IDE
            from <em>ESP32S3-dev</em> to <em>ESP32-dev</em>. The code
            compiled (very slowly!), and it flashed - common sense and
            a good error message had saved the day, or so it seemed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the code had written to the flash storage, it went
            to reset the device. It seemed to hang on that message.
            No bother, things sometimes take a while, I'll go make a
            cup of tea while it finishes up. After I had finished
            staining my teeth with delicious taurine, I came back to
            check on Watchy, but it still hadn't reset. I waited a
            bit longer but nothing happened. E-Ink displays aren't
            particularly helpful here is they maintain their last
            image, so I wasn't sure if it had worked but the buttons
            had stopped working, or if it hadn't worked, until enough
            time had passed for me to be sure the time wasn't
            updating.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even in the preloaded demo, the buttons seemed somewhat
            unresponsive when trying to operate the Watchy. In
            particular, I couldn't seem to get the thing to reset or
            go into boot select mode. After searching online I was
            worried that it would require soldering to fix the button
            or the reset - I am not very exeperienced with soldering,
            and on such small components I am sure it would look as
            though something has sneezed metal across the board once
            I was done with it.
