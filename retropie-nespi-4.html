            The Raspberry Pi 4, with Retroflag's NesPi4 Case, running RetroPie
            is the ultimate retro gaming rig. Lower power consumption? Check.
            Light gun games? You got it. Great customisation options? Of course.
            Did you know you can even you a wiimote as the stylus for the Drastic
            Nintendo DS Emulator?? Did I hear someone say Wario Ware?

            I've gone through a few different renditions of hardware, cases
            and software for my retrogaming rig. I use Recalbox on a GPi case
            2 with compute module 4 (no wifi), and have also used it on this
            device. However, I found myself coming back to RetroPie for the
            NesPi 4 case and my main rig. Recalbox is certainly a great
            piece of software, and even has easy set up for the case, however
            RetroPie just lets you do so much more, and also I found Recalbox
            to occasionally break after updates - not often, but often enough
            for me to notice a pattern.
