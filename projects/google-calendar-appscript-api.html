        <p id="intro">
            Considering how long they've been around, working with
            iCal's in the browser is surprisingly difficult. When
            working with data from Google Calendar, we can use
            Google's Apps Script to create an API, that will let us
            pull exactly what we desire down from a Google Calendar.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is actually a great JavaScript module called
            <a href="https://github.com/kewisch/ical.js/"
            target="_blank">ical.js</a>, but as I write this in June
            2024 it seems to be broken. At first I thought it may be
            that Google had decided not to play nice, and changed their
            iCal format, but upon testing other ics files from other
            services, I was getting the same errors from the module
            I had built from source, as well as on various iCal JS
            validators online. So hopefully this reaches someone in
            a similar situation that I found myself in.
        </p>

        <h2 id="use-case">Use Case</h2>
        <p>
            A good static website should require as little work as
            possible, and that work should be as accessible as
            possible. I was making a static website, intended to show
            upcoming events for a youth group. Youth workers aren't
            necessarily techno-literate, and probably don't have a
            lot of time to do that kind of stuff anyway. So, I
            decided that the website should just update itself via
            a Google Calendar - easy! Or at least that's what I
            thought.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from iCalJS, which I've already mentioned, the only
            really easy option here, at least to my knowledge, is to use
            an iFrame which Google provides in it's calendar settings
            and sharing options. But those things are ugly. Butt ugly.
            I've used Apps Script in the past to serve a web app
            designed just to do some very basic bookings management
            using a Google Sheet as the backend - roll your eyes if
            you must, but it worked and best of all it was free. So if
            you can serve HTML via Google's Apps Script service, then
            you should be able to serve some json data too, right?
        </p>

        <h2 id="serving-json">Serving JSON</h2>
        <p>
            You <em>can</em> serve JSON using Google's Apps Script
            service. But, you can only access it in a Chromium type
            browser - it just won't work in firefox, and CORS makes
            it virtually impossible to work with in a static site.
        </p>
        <p>
            To serve HTML web apps or JSON, you need to use the
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/content"
            target="_blank">Apps Script Content Service</a>. They do
            also have a third option in that, which is called JSONP.
            You're not alone if you've never heard of that, I hadn't
            either. It stands for JSON with Padding, and wikipedia
            describes it as
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            .. a historical JavaScript technique for requesting data
            by loading a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element, which is
            an element intended to load ordinary javascript.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            That sounds both fun and dangerous! Sensibly, Google issues
            a warning for when working with JSONP:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            Warning: Be very careful when using this JSONP technique
            in your scripts. Because it's possible for anyone to embed
            the script tag in their web page, you can be tricked into
            executing the script when you visit a malicious website,
            which can then capture the data returned. Best practice is
            to ensure that JSONP scripts are read-only and only return
            non-sensitive information.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The script I am making will only be returning GET requests
            with information that is on a public Google calendar, so
            for me at least, it's safe to go on..
        </p>

        <h2 id="api">Creating the API</h2>
        <p>
            To begin, in your Google Drive, select <em>New</em>, then
            <em>More</em>, and if <em>Google Apps Script</em> isn't
            already on that menu, you will need to choose
            <em>Connect More Apps</em> and choose Apps Script from
            there.
        </p>
        <p>
            To use the Apps Script Content Service, you need a
            function called <code>doGet</code>, which will send the
            data we want to receive from our API as JSON content.
            That function needs to return a
            <code>ContentService</code> class instance, with the
            method <code>createTextOutput</code> specifying the
            JSON data we wish to return, here being our <code>res</code>
            (or <code>response</code>) object. And finally, we need
            to also invoke the <code>setMimeType</code> method,
            and set it to JAVASCRIPT, so it returns as JSONP, instead
            of JSON.
        </p>

        <pre class="language-javascript"><code>const doGet = () => {
    const holidayHoursCalID = '&lt;calendar-id&gt;@group.calendar.google.com';
    const eventsCalID = '&lt;calendar-id&gt;@group.calendar.google.com';

    const res = {
        'data': {
            holidayHours: getEvents(holidayHoursCalID),
            events: getEvents(eventsCalID),
        }
    };

    return ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify(res))
        .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JAVASCRIPT);
};</code></pre>

        <p>
            The code I am using to get the calendar info to populate
            the <code>response</code> object in <code>doGet</code>
            simply takes each calendar's ID as a parameter, defines
            a start datetime (now), and an end (+1 year), and collects
            and maps the start, end, title and description from
            each calendar entry that is returned.
        </p>

        <pre class="language-javascript"><code>const getEvents = id => {
    const cal = CalendarApp.getCalendarById(id);
    const start = new Date();
    const end = new Date();
    end.setFullYear(end.getFullYear() + 1)

    const calData = cal.getEvents(start, end).map(i => ({
        start: i.getStartTime(),
        end: i.getEndTime(),
        title: i.getTitle(),
        description: i.getDescription()
    }));

    return calData;
};</code></pre>

        <p>
            Next, we need to deploy the web app. Deploy it as a Web App,
            not as API executable. You will also need to set the access
            permissions to <em>Anyone</em> for it to be accessible
            wherever you want to call it from. It will provide you with
            a web app URL, that if you now enter that into your browser,
            should send you back your JSON data, assuming everyting's
            set up and working correctly. In my case, I receive something
            like this:
        </p>

        <pre class="language-javascript"><code>"data": {
    "holidayHours":[
        {
            "start":"2024-07-24T23:00:00.000Z",
            "end":"2024-08-30T23:00:00.000Z",
            "title":"Summer Holiday",
            "description":"Open 12 - 6pm everyday (except bank holidays)"
        },
        {
            "start":"2024-08-25T23:00:00.000Z",
            "end":"2024-08-26T23:00:00.000Z",
            "title":"Bank holiday",
            "description":"CLOSED"
        }
    ],
    "events":[
        {
            "start":"2024-06-20T23:00:00.000Z",
            "end":"2024-06-21T23:00:00.000Z",
            "title":"Pride event",
            "description":"An art workshop for Pride!"
        },
        {
            "start":"2024-07-06T15:00:00.000Z",
            "end":"2024-07-06T17:00:00.000Z",
            "title":"CLT event",
            "description":"A community art project:\n\"Postcards From Our Future\""
        }
    ]
}</code></pre>

        <aside>
            NOTE: You will need to update the url in your API call
            whenever you make changes to the API and redeploy.
        </aside>

        <h2 id="api-call">Calling the API From a Webpage</h2>
        <p>
            So this method is free. It works, but you get what you
            pay for, and we can't always be sure it will work every
            time that it's called. There are limits on how many Apps
            Script calls can be made, so if the tik tok web crawler
            takes an interest in the web page this is being called
            from, things are going to break. With this in mind, I
            opted to use the (very ugly) iFrames as a fallback, in
            case for whatever reason the API call is unable to fetch
            data I need. It is likely that I will monitor the situation
            with iCalJS, and if that ends up working at some point,
            that will become my first port of call, with this Apps
            Script API becoming a fallback for <em>that</em>, and the
            iFrames becoming a final fallback if all else fails.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm not going to go through the in's and out's of
            formatting Date objects and manipulating the DOM, so you
            will have to design your own calendar entry cards or
            calendar table or however you want to display the data.
            Instead, I will just look at calling the API itself, and
            having the iFrames as a fallback.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm using an async function, to call the <code>fetch</code>
            method on the URL provided for the Apps Script API that I've
            set up. Apps Script calls work by being redirected by the
            content service itself, so be sure to include
            <code>redirect: 'follow'</code> as an option.
        </p>
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code>const getEvents = async () => {
    const res = await fetch(
        'https://script.google.com/macros/s/&lt;script-url&gt;/exec',
        {
            redirect: 'follow'
        }
    );

    const { data } = await res.json();
    return data;
}</code></pre>
        <p>
            Finally, we just need to call that <code>getEvents</code>
            function that returns the JSON data, and do something
            with the data. I am only logging to the console in this
            example. There are checks to see if there are events or not,
            and then it is wrapped in a <code>try</code> statement, so
            if the API call fails, then the iFrames can be initiated
            within the <code>catch</code> statement. This entire
            process gets initiated within a <code>DOMContentLoaded</code>
            event listener, which, in my opinion, is good practise most
            of the time when working with the DOM in JavaScript.
        </p>
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code>const populateLists = async () => {
    try {
        const data = await getEvents();
        const { events, holidayHours } = data;

        if (events.length) {
            events.forEach(event => {
                console.log(event);
            });
        } else {
            console.log('No events information available');
        };
        
        if (holidayHours.length) {
            holidayHours.forEach(event => {
                console.log(event);
            });
        } else {
            console.log('No holiday information available');
        };
    } catch (e) {
        const eventFrame = `&lt;iframe&gt;COPY AND PASTED FROM GOOGLE&lt;/iframe&gt;`;
        const termDateFrame = `&lt;iframe&gt;COPY AND PASTED FROM GOOGLE&lt;/iframe&gt;`;
        eventList.innerHTML = eventFrame;
        termDatesList.innerHTML = termDateFrame;
    }
};

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', populateLists)</code></pre>

        <h2 id="hide-url">Hiding your script URL</h2>
        <p>
            Having your Apps Script url in your JavaScript file on
            a static website leaves it in plain view of anyone who
            knows how to get to it. To be able to use it in a
            website, we have had to allow access to it by anyone,
            so it is potentially open to being spammed by anyone
            who just plain doesn't like you. But, certain static
            website hosting providers, do provide serverless
            functions, which can allow us to call the script URL
            discreetly from a psuedo backend. I will be using
            <a href="https://www.netlify.com/"
            target="_blank">Netlify</a>. Although there is still
            an API link in our frontend JavaScript that could still
            potentially be spammed, it is a Netlify link, rather
            than a Google macro, which will give us a little
            extra in terms of load balancing and spamming
            protection. Other providers often offer Lambda
            Functions within their services, much to the same
            affect as Netlify's functions.
        </p>
        <p>
            To begin, we will need to create a <code>.env</code>
            file in the root of our webpage directory - but don't
            worry, we don't need the dotenv node module here, so
            no need to initialise a node project - it is however
            worth running <code>npm i -g netlify-cli</code> for
            testing purposes. In the
            <code>.env</code> file, we do the usual, and list
            our <em>secret</em> with a key and value.
        </p>
        <aside>
            NOTE: If the script url has been published in a public
            repo or file, it may be best to create a new script
            deployment and archive the old one.
        </aside>
        <pre class="language-none"><code>APPS_SCRIPT="https://script.google.com/macros/s/&lt;script-url&gt;/exec"</code></pre>
        <aside>
            NOTE: Make sure to add the dotenv file to .gitignore
            if you haven't already got in in your global gitignore
            config.
        </aside>
        <p>
            In your Netlify project, you will also set this as an
            environment variable. Now, to create the netlify
            function, we need to create a <code>netlify</code>
            directory, and a <code>functions</code> directory
            within that. Any JavaScript files within the
            <code>functions</code> directory will be treated as
            a backend API url.
        </p>
        <pre class="language-none"><code>/
index.html
assets/
    ...
netlify/
    functions/
        api.js</code></pre>
        <p>
            For our API function, we just need to export one
            default function, that takes <code>request</code>
            and <code>context</code> parameters, and returns
            a <code>Response</code> instance. This will be viewable
            if your project repo is public, but by using the
            <code>Netlify.env.get()</code> method, we can collect
            our secret from the dotenv file in development, and
            from the Netlify environment variable we've already
            set up while in production.
        </p>
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code>export default async (req, context) => {
    const api = Netlify.env.get('APPS_SCRIPT');
    
    const res = await fetch(api, {
        redirect: 'follow'
    });
    const { data } = await res.json();

    return new Response(JSON.stringify(data));
};</code></pre>
        <p>
            Now that we have done that, we just need to update the api
            call in our <code>app.js</code> file on the frontend
            to reflect the changes. URL's for netlify functions
            read as
            <code>&lt;project-url&gt;/.netlify/functions/&lt;file-name&gt;</code>.
            Note that the <code>.js</code> file extension is not
            included in the url. Once that is completed, just
            push the project, and you're done!
        </p>
        <pre class="language-javascript"><code>const getEvents = async () => {
    const res = await fetch('/.netlify/functions/api');

    const data = await res.json();

    return data;

        <p>
            I'm not here to say Google is good or bad, it offers
            amazing services - a lot of them for free. But it is
            a very big entity. There's loads of amazing developers
            there that clearly have a passion for delivering
            fantastic products and services for people. And then
            there's also, well, all the other stuff. But politics
            aside, you ought to know that as an entity, Google can
            be fickle, and a service that exists today, could cease
            to exist tomorrow. There's even been some really popular
            and succesful services that have just been cut, seemingly
            overnight and for no reason - check out the Google Graveyard
            at <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/"
            target="_blank">Killed by Google</a> to see for yourself.
            So while they can offer great solutions to those of us
            working on a tight budget, it's important to recognise
            that they are under no obligation to do so, and that we
            won't always have the same solutions available to us
            tomorrow.
