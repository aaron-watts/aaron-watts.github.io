        <p id="intro">
            I didn't intend to write an article about Watchy, as I
            only bought it to satisfy my nerd fetish. But after the
            trouble I had getting it to work, I thought I might write
            a short guide to assist anyone who might run into some of
            the same issues I did.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://watchy.sqfmi.com/" 
            target="_blank">Watchy</a>, by SQFMI, is an awesome
            gadget. In short it's a programmable watch, that you
            assemble yourself, with added wifi and accelerometer.
            It doesn't necessarily connect to your phone, so it's
            not a <em>smart</em> watch <em>per se</em>, but it is a
            clever watch. But, and it's a big but, the documentation
            is somewhat lacking. Unless you end up with the V3 watchy,
            the little documentation there is, is utterly useless.
        </p>
        <p>
            I bought mine from the <a href="https://thepihut.com"
            target="_blank">The Pi Hut</a>, which, according to the
            description on their site is a V2. If you end up with
            anything less than a V3, don't even bother with the
            <a href="https://watchy.sqfmi.com/docs/getting-started/"
            target="_blank">documentation</a> beyond the initial
            assembly, because it won't work.
        </p>

        <h2 id="signs">First Signs Something Is Wrong</h2>
        <p>
            So after assembly, and following the documentation to a
            tee, I tried the first seemingly obvious and easy thing
            to customise my watchy; I tried to change the watch
            face using one of the provided examples in the Arduino
            IDE. First I got an error that told me that my device
            was <em>ESP32</em> and not <em>ESP32-S3</em>. The error
            killed the operation. So, perhaps foolishly, seeing there
            wasn't really a solution offered within the docs, I did
            what that error told me, and switched boards in the IDE
            from <em>ESP32S3-dev</em> to <em>ESP32-dev</em>. The code
            compiled (very slowly!), and it flashed - common sense and
            a good error message had saved the day, or so it seemed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the code had written to the flash storage, it went
            to reset the device. It seemed to hang on that message.
            No bother, things sometimes take a while, I'll go make a
            cup of tea while it finishes up. After I had finished
            staining my teeth with delicious taurine, I came back to
            check on Watchy, but it still hadn't reset. I waited a
            bit longer but nothing happened. E-Ink displays aren't
            particularly helpful here as they maintain their last
            image, so I wasn't sure if it had worked but the buttons
            had stopped working, or if it hadn't worked, until enough
            time had passed for me to be sure the time wasn't
            updating.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even in the preloaded demo, the buttons seemed somewhat
            unresponsive when trying to operate the Watchy. In
            particular, I couldn't seem to get the thing to reset or
            go into boot select mode. After searching online I was
            worried that it would require soldering to fix a button
            or the reset - I am not very exeperienced with soldering,
            and on such small components I am sure it would look as
            though something has sneezed metal across the board once
            I was done with it.
        </p>

        <h2 id="model">Figuring Out Which Model You Have</h2>
        <p>
            So, as I mentioned, the docs are useless now. There is
            a Discord server where you can find some help, but
            personally, I'm not the biggest fan of chat rooms - they
            have their place of course, and that is on dial up back
            in the early 2000's. Anyway, I did it, so you don't have
            to, but if you enjoy trawling through messages upon
            messages that aren't necessarily the same conversation
            as you are partaking in, then be my guest.
        </p>
        <p>
            One issue with working with Watchy in Arduino IDE, is
            that it's slow, <em>really slow</em>. Luckily, there's
            a python package and a couple of binaries we can use to
            quickly figure out if which version of Watchy we have.
            Szybet's <a href="https://github.com/Szybet/InkWatchy/wiki/Trying-out-the-demo-firmware"
            target="_blank">InkWatchy</a> firmware has a couple of
            <a href="https://github.com/Szybet/InkWatchy/releases"
            target="_blank">binary demo's</a> we can quickly flash
            to Watchy, and see which one works. To do so, we will
            need a Python package called ESPTool.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have mentioned quite a few times before, in previous
            articles, that nowadays I compute exclusively on a
            Raspberry Pi. Unfortunately there wasn't an esptool
            package in apt, and from what I have read elsewhere,
            what you can get in apt on other distro's is pretty
            outdated. To install
            esptool, first create a directory where you can work
            on your Watchy stuff, maybe call it <code>watchy/</code>
            or something like that. Then, inside that directory,
            create a virtual environment where you can install
            esptool.
        </p>
        <aside>
            NOTE: always make sure to deactivate the virtual
            environment before closing your terminal!
        </aside>
        <pre class="language-none"><code># create virtual environment
python -m venv esptoolenv

# activate virtual environment
source esptoolenv/bin/activate

# install package
pip3 install esptool==4.5.dev2

# deactivate virtual environment
deactivate</code></pre>
        <p>
            Now we have the virtual environment set up, copy those
            two firmware binaries over to the parent directory of
            the vitrual environment, and we can try to flash each
            one using the following instructions.
        </p>
        <pre class="language-none"><code>source esptoolenv/bin/activate
esptool.py write_flash 0x00000 &lt;demo-name&gt;.bin</code></pre>
        <p>
            If <code>Watchy_3-demo.bin</code> works, you have a
            V3 Watchy, and you probably just need to make sure you
            are using up to date versions of the esprissif ESP
            Board and Watchy libraries. If 
            <code>Watchy_2-demo.bin</code> then you have a V2 or
            lower, and will need to change a few things in your
            Arduino IDE to get the Watchy to flash, so read on.
        </p>

        <h2 id="arduino">Setting Up The Arduino IDE</h2>
        <p>
            If you are also using a Raspberry Pi 5 like me, you
            might have noticed that the Arduino IDE has gone missing
            from the reccomended software app. We still have a few
            options for installation though. There is an apt package,
            but it's ugly as hell and the menu's don't pick up on the
            theming. There is also a version in Pi-Apps, but to be
            safe, I am using the
            <a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/Linux/"
            target="_blank">legacy version</a> from the official
            website, and everything works with it. You will still
            want to follow the instructions in the
            <a href="https://watchy.sqfmi.com/docs/getting-started#arduino-setup"
            target="_blank">Watchy Docs</a> with regards to setting
            up Arduino, except instead of installing
            <code>v2.0.17+</code> of the esp32 platform, install
            <code>v2.0.11</code>. And, instead of the latest version
            of the Watchy library, install <code>1.4.7</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead of choosing the ESP32S3-Dev Module board, scroll
            down in the <em>ESP Arduino</em> boards list until you
            find <em>Watchy</em>, and select that. Under
            <em>Board Revision</em>, <em>Watchy v1.0</em> seems to
            work well - the buttons seemed far more responsive after
            flashing with this option than when in the preinstalled
            demo firmware, so I haven't actually tried the other
            versions as of yet. Your next attempt to flash Watchy 
            using the Arduino IDE should now work, so don't throw it 
            in the parts bin!
        </p>

        <h2 id="customising">Customising Watchy</h2>
        <p>
            I'm not going to go into detail here, after all this is
            the fun of having a Watchy. Go hack and learn some stuff
            about programming. However, as a hint, the Watchy
            firmware library is in
            <code>~/Arduino/libraries/Watchy/src/</code>, just in
            case you might want to try and figure out a better
            alternative to Watchy displaying it's own internal
            temperature when it doesn't have a wifi connection to
            retreive weather data. And if you want to try another
            firmware on top of the two we've seen here,
            <a href="https://github.com/GuruSR/Watchy_GSR/tree/master"
            target="_blank">Watchy_GSR</a> is worth a look and has
            much better documentation than Watchy does itself!
        </p>

        <h3>Fonts</h3>
        <p>
            The online font converter was down when I went to use it.
            It seems to be back online now. But just in case there is
            an issue with it when you go to use it yourself, you can
            get the tool itself from an Arduino library within the
            Arduino IDE. Just <code>cd</code> into the following
            directory and <code>make</code> the binary yourself, then
            you can convert your fonts for Watchy yourself.
        </p>
        <pre class="language-none"><code>cd ~/Arduino/libraries/Adafruit_GFX_Library/fontconvert
make
./fontconvert &lt;path-to-font&gt; &lt;size&gt; &gt;&gt; my_font.h</code></pre>
    </main>
