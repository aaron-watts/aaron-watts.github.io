    <h1>
        Technology
    </h1>
    <div>
        Tech today is a daunting minefield. When I choose my tech,
        be it hardware or software, I try to choose technology
        that I consider to be <em>thoughful</em>. I praise tech
        that is affordable, ethical, and most of all useful.
        Here I will write about some of my choices of tech and
        talk about why I consider it to be <em>thoughtful</em>.
        This is not to convince you to buy things, I am writing
        here just to express what I believe to be good tech, and
        hopefully others will learn something new or feel provoked
        to think more about what tech they use day to day.

                Fairphone, based in Netherlands, brings something
            back to smartphones that most people don't even
            realise is missing. Their approach aims to promote
            user ownership of a device, and longevity.
