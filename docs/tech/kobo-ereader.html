            Kobo e-reader's won't do too much more than an Amazon Kindle,
            unless you are outside of the US. Kobo do just enough
            differently that I'd consider them to be thoughtful
            technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can resist a trend, and tend not to jump onto very many things
            early. Amazon was one of those things. One of my first
            experiences with Amazon, that I still encounter today, is
            older relatives asking how to cancel a subscription that
            they didn't know they had. This happens a lot, it's like Amazon
            design their interfaces to intentionally trick people who are not
            tech literate into accidentally subscribing to additional
            services. And Kindle may be the biggest offender in that respect.
        </p>
        <p>
            My mum is one such tech illiterate person, and the problem
            had become common enough to put her off trying to use her
            Kindle. E-readers tend to be pretty locked down in terms of
            software, so unless you are able to make modifications or
            track down an obscure model that is probably not suitable
            for tech noobs, then you're kind of stuck with what you
            get out of the box.
        </p>
        <p>
            While looking for a different device for my mum, I found
            out about <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby"
            target="_blank">Libby and Overdrive</a>, an e-book
            library system. I thought this was amazing, and wondered
            why it wasn't included as standard in Kindle's. I later
            found out that it is in fact included in Kindles, but 
            not outside of the United States. However, I soon 
            discovered that the <a href="https://www.kobo.com/"
            target="_blank">Kobo</a> e-readers do include Overdrive,
            even here in the UK.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overdrive requires a library card for your local library,
            and despite being digital, there are only so many copies
            of a e-book that can be <em>"borrowed"</em>, so it can be
            a bit of a wait for more popular titles, if they are even
            available at all. My mum is an keen and unfussy reader,
            so despite the limitations, this is a perfect system for
            her.
        </p>
        <p>
            After setting up a Kobo for my mum, I was pleased with
            what I was seeing, and <em>finally</em> made the transition
            from paper to electronic books myself, although I keep mine
            offline and manage my own library using the
            <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/"
            target="_blank">Calibre</a> e-book management software.
