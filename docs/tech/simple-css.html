      <p id="description">
        Simple CSS was suggested to me by a friend. At the time I had
        been making an effort to try and learn web development. In essence,
        it is yet another CSS framework to bootstrap your HTML for fast
        production. Except, it's not, not really. I'd argue, it's better.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first thing that makes <a href="https://simplecss.org/"
          target="_blank">Simple CSS</a> by <a href="https://kevquirk.com/"
          target="_blank">Kev Quirk</a> so good compared to other CSS
        frameworks, is that it's not strictly a framework - it's just
        one file. One tiny CSS file. No <code>reset.css</code>, no
        javascript.
      </p>
      
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          ..the minified CSS for the Bootstrap framework is 144KB in total.
          By comparison, Simple.css is around 10KB
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        It also describes itself as mostly classless. The
        <a href="https://simplecss.org/introducing-simple-classes"
          target="_blank">Simple Classes</a> page describes
        merely two classes: <code>a.button</code> and
        <code>p.notice</code>.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          ..makes semantic HTML look good, really quickly
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Being classless, it focuses on semantic HTML. This means
        Simple CSS also becomes a fantastic learning resource. The
        MDN docs are great, but reading and retaining all of that
        is quite a task. The specs for HTML alone are just so vast,
        let alone CSS and Javascript. All to often, CSS magic or
        Javascript wizadry, or a combination of both, get employed
        to perform a task that HTML can just do already, out of the
        box. Take the <code>details</code> HTML element for example,
        collapsible and hideable using <em>HTML only</em>!
      </p>

      <p>
        Not only is Simple CSS efficient and useful, it's also an
        introduction to good practises for those of us who've
        been swept along by the Bootstrapped boot-camps. Learning
        about the efficiency of good semantics has sent me on a
        bit of learning quest for good, and standardised, practises
        that I might otherwise not thought to have seek out, so
        thank you Kev. And I hope others slow down to look at the
        <code>doctree</code>'s too, eh? (it's supposed to be a play on
        that smell the flowers .. ah forget it, a joke that has to be
        explained is a bad one).
