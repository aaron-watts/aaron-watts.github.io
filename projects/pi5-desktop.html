        <p id="intro">
            This is less of a guide, and more just an outline of how,
            and why, I'm doing it. As well as a review of how it's
            going. It's not here as clickbait, you might not want to
            do it yourself, but I'm here to say that it's working for
            me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I know. There are hundreds of articles on this. But they
            are all out to prove that something is worth doing or not.
            This isn't that. It's not hyped up, undeserving praise, nor
            is it phobic criticism. I have genuinely switched from a
            <em>classical</em> desktop computer, to using a Raspberry Pi
            5, and it works for me. Really well, in fact!
        </p>

        <h2 id="why">But, why?</h2>
        <p>
            This might be the wrong question. Maybe, it was more: how?
            I don't work in tech, it's just a hobby of mine. Nor do I make
            heaps of expendable money to blow on tech. My last desktop
            computer was a Dell Optiplex 3050, with some variant of an
            intel i5 processor. I found it next to the communal bins
            outside my flat. There was nothing wrong with it. I adopted
            it, cleaned it, installed linux, plugged in some additional
            RAM and it was a great computer. I even found an old AMD
            graphics card that fit it. It's still here, it still works.
            I was trying out the i3wm community edition of EndeavourOS,
            and it was great (I love i3wm!). There was an update a little
            while ago to lightDM, the login manager for that flavour of
            EndeavourOS. I fixed it on my laptop at work, which also runs
            the same flavour distro, but I suppose the graphics card in
            my desktop means there's extra steps to take for the desktop,
            I dunno, I still haven't looked yet. But I also didn't want
            to lose some files from my SSD, so I've left it on the shelf
            until I can be bothered to sort that out. What's important
            about that story, is it broke in the morning, as I was
            about to begin the work I do as my job for the day. I didn't
            have anything else on hand to do my job, and I needed to
            clock in soon. As luck would have it, my Macbook Pro 2012's
            keyboard had just degraded beyond the point of no return a
            week or two prior, which left me a little stuck.
        </p>

            What I <em>did</em> have, was a Raspberry Pi 4 on my desk.
            Yes, I know, this is about Raspberry Pi 5, I will get to that.
            Anyway, we've all seen the misleading videos on youtube that
            make sponsor-bucks by luring viewers into assuming that a
            pi 4 will run as their daily driver and get the job done.
            I know better than to rely on it. But for my job, which is
            mostly emails, documents, spreadsheets, and some databases
            that look like they were designed to run in internet explorer.
            So I powered up my pi 4, and did my job. And, it worked. I
            mean, it was a little slower than I was used to, and it did
            struggle a little at times, but I got everything done that
            I needed to. And then a few days later, while I was working
            and my trusty pi 4 was ticking along shouldering its load,
            I got a notification that the pi 5 was now in stock. I bought
            my pi 5, from my pi 4. Neat.
        </p>
        <p>
            My pi 4 got reassigned, and I set up the 5 with the new version
            of the argon one case and an M.2. NVME SSD drive, and just ..
            carried on working.
        </p>

        <h2 id="good-enough">Is it good enough?</h2>
        <p>
            Yes. I mean, for me, it is. I won't lie, pi 4 can get the job
            done. But it suffers while it does it, and at the end of the
            day, it goes home, falls straight to sleep, all the while
            growing more and more distant from it's wife and children.
            The pi 5, on the other hand, doesn't yet comprehend the
            evils and injustices of the world, and has enough ambition
            and energy to perform at it's tasks, and get to live a
            good quality of life at the end of the day too.
        </p>
        <p>
            What do you want it to do? Personally, I use my pi for the
            work I've already mentioned, some coding, and projects and
            nerdery. I'm not trying to game on it, I'm not trying to
            edit videos on it. Though, there is evidence on youtube
            that it can actually do the latter to an acceptable standard!
            There are, naturally, some hurdles involved with integrating
            a linux device into a world that doesn't even know it's name.
            And too the ARM architecture causes one or two nags here and
            there. But things are improving, all the time, and for my use
            case, I've been able to get everything running in a way that
            causes me no hinderence, to the point that this is now my
            only computer on my desk.
        </p>
        <p>
            One huge win over using a more typical device, is the
            electricity usage. It uses almost none. I leave this pi, and
            another that I use specifically as a web radio and music
            streaming device running volumio, both running all day long.
            All day. It uses less electric than making toast in the toaster
            ONCE. I shit you not. If you care about the environment or the
            energy crisis, that should make you happy. But if like me,
            you are more concerned with keeping your pockets lined with
            copper, then you should also get a kick out of that too.
