            <p id="description">
              I built this media centre at the start of 2024. There may
              be easier methods of installation by now. When I built this
              project, existing guides mentioned an installation image
              on KDE's bigscreen page, however, it doesn't seem to exist
              currently, except for a manjaro image, and I prefer to stick
              to Raspberry Pi's own debian OS when I can, especially that
              it ensures the best compatibility with things like cases and
              accessories.
            </p>
            <p>
              Feel free to change and tweak what you like to what suits you,
              however, things you will need are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Raspberry Pi 4b (2GB RAM+)</li>
              <li>USB storage device</li>
              <li>Some kind of cooling system</li>
              <li>Something to do buttons on</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I used a pi 4b 4GB RAM model myself for this project, as
              it was the unit that my pi 5 replaced on my work desk.
              While testing the system, I never pushed the RAM much past
              1.7GB, so I think anything 2GB or higher will run okay.
              Anything lower than a pi 4 is going to struggle rendering
              KDE - the pi 4 needs an overclock to get everything running
              smoothly, hence the required cooling system. I used the
              Argon One case with the sata M.2. drive expansion, however
              I got similar results with preformance running from a USB
              3.0 thumb drive. Plasma bigscreen, while offering limited
              support for remote controls, doesn't come with apps, so we
              will be using web-apps through the chromium browser, so
              some kind of keyboard is advised - KDE Connect on an android
              phone works great here, or you can get mini wireless keyboards
              with built in track pads on amazon.
            </p>

          <section id="getting-started">
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>
              Start by flashing the latest
              <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/" target="_blank">
                  64-bit Raspberry Pi OS Lite</a>
              to a usb device. You may need to
              <a href="https://www.raspberrystreet.com/learn/how-to-boot-raspberrypi-from-usb-ssd" target="_blank">
                  update the EEPROM</a>
              if you haven't already in order to boot from USB. Take
              advantage of rpi imager settings here to enable SSH and
              change hostname so you can tell it apart from the 6 other
              pi's you have running around your house. If using a
              different imaer then don't forget to include the SSH
              file as you may need it on the next step.
            </p>
            <p>
              After initial boot, the screen may black out, using the
              same image I had this happen with the USB SSB, but not
              the USB thumb drive - your guess is as good as mine..
              If it blacks out then ssh in and vi or nano into
              <code>/boot/firmware/config.txt</code> and comment out
              and add the following lines:
            </p>
            <pre class="language-none"><code>#dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d
dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d</code></pre>
            <p>
              Now that the screen is working you can log into the
              session, and make the usual prayer
              <code>sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y</code>
              followed by a <code>sudo reboot</code> for luck.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="installing-kde-plasma">
            <h2>Installing KDE Plasma</h2>
            <p>
              Next we need to istall KDE Plasma; I ooriginally went
              for <code>kde-plasma-desktop</code> as its the lighter
              install, but it kept hanging at boot, you ight have more
              luck, but expect to start again if it fails.
            </p>
            <pre class="language-none command-line"
            data-user="aaronwatts" data-host="dev"><code>sudo apt install kde-standard</code></pre>
            <p>
              After that, another reboot for luck. Then we need to
              activate the sddm login manager service, and tell
              raspi OS that we want to boot into GUI on the next
              boot:
            </p>
            <pre class="language-none command-line"
            data-user="aaronwatts" data-host="dev"><code>sudo systemctl enable sddm
sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target</code></pre>
            <p>
              And reboot again. It should now boot into Plasma,
              and the first thing you should do is disable all the
              destkop effects; older pi KDE Plasma guides suggest
              to disable the compositor, but the session defaults
              to wayland unless you tell it not, and wayland can't
              run without the compositor - I've noticed no major
              differences between X11 and wayland myself in this
              use case (don't believe the hype).
            </p>
            <aside>
              Note: disabling compositor in X causes screen tearing
              on video playback, so even if you choose to use X,
              leave the compositor on and just disable effects.
            </aside>
            <p>
              If you're also using an Argon One case, now is the
              time to open up konsole and install the power and
              fan control:
            </p>
            <pre class="language-none command-line"

          <section id="setting-up-plasma-bigscreen">
            <h2>Setting Up Plasma Bigscreen</h2>
            <p>
              Now the effects are disabled, and if you have your
              cooling set up, now is a good time to overclock,
              so back into <code>/boot/firmware/config.txt</code>.
              I just went with the following:
            </p>
            <pre class="language-none"><code># Overclock
over_voltage=6
arm_freq=2000
gpu_freq=700</code></pre>
            <p>
              Next we can install the other bits we need:
            </p>
            <pre class="language-none command-line"
            data-user="aaronwatts" data-host="dev"><code>sudo apt install chromium-browser rpi-chromium-mods plasma-bigscreen</code></pre>
            <p>
              If you want to watch DRM services like netflix you
              need another package that's not included in lite:
            </p>
            <pre class="language-none command-line"
            data-user="aaronwatts" data-host="dev"><code>sudo apt install libwidevinecdm0</code></pre>
            <p>
              KDE connect and an android phone make the perfect
              remote control, connect should already be included
              in the KDE install. But firewall suggested, with
              KDE connect and SSH rules:
            </p>
            <pre class="language-none command-line"
            data-user="aaronwatts" data-host="dev"><code>sudo apt install ufw
sudo ufw allow 1714:1764/upd
sudo ufw allow 1714:1764/tcp
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
sudo ufw enable</code></pre>
            <p>
              Next open chromium, add the extensions you want,
              and <em>"install"</em> your <em>"web apps"</em>.
            </p>
            <aside>
              Note: skip the splash screen - instead of installing
              web app when your on <u>questionable.com</u>, go to
              <u>questionable.com/home</u> and install from there.
            </aside>

            </aside>
            <aside>
              Update: with the introduction of Web Manifest V3 to
              Chromium based browsers, you may prefer to set your
              web apps to run through Firefox. Firefox for desktop
              doesn't support this natively, but there is a guide on
              how to set this up
              <a href="/guides/firefox-web-apps">here</a>.
            </aside>
            <p>
              Now open up KDE settings again, select
              <em>Startup and Shutdown > Login Screen (SDDM)</em>,
              and then click the behaviour button at the bottom and
              set plasma to log in automatically and change the session
              to bigscreen, enter your password to confirm, and it
              should prompt you to set a password for the keychain.
              I set a blank password because I want other people to
              be able to use the TV. Also disbale power saving, or
              at least getting sent back to the login screen after
              sleep.
            </p>
            <p>
              Done! Reboot and enjoy!

          <section id="controls">
            <h2>Controls</h2>

            <h3>KDE Connect</h3>
            <p>
              By far the best option if you have an android phone or
              tablet lying around. KDE Connect for android is available
              in the standard
              <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.kde.kdeconnect_tp/" target="_blank">F-Droid repository</a>. The
              app includes
              a big screen feature, but you can get most of what you need
              done using the remote input feature.
            </p>
            <aside>
              As a side, <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/juloo.keyboard2/" target="_blank">Unexpected
                  Keyboard</a> is a configurable
              keyboard for android that includes all the keys you might
              need to use the terminal.
            </aside>

            <h3>Mini Wireless Keyboard with Touchpad</h3>
            <p>
              The
              <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01G6XGLQQ" target="_blank">Rii K01X1 2.4GHz Mini Wireless
                  Keyboard
                  with Touchpad Remote Control</a> is the perfect companion
              for interacting with Plasma Bigscreen. However the range
              doesn't appear to be very long, especially on the Argon
              One case where the receiver plugged in at the back due to the
              Argon remote interacting with the front of the case.
              However this can be easily remedied with a short
              <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09LYRRQ91" target="_blank">USB extension cable</a>
              to point the receiver in the correct
              direction.
            </p>

            <h3>Argon IR Remote</h3>
            <p>
              As I previously mentioned, I am using an Argon One case,
              which is great as I get to use the Argon IR remote control.
              However, the debian version of Plasma Bigscreen doesn't
              have a working option to configure remotes as yet, so the
              remote is somewhat useless for now - except for the power
              button that is. And I love being able to power my pi on
              and off without leaving my sofa and walking the few feet
              required to do it manually. If you are using an Argon One
              case, the setup script should get everything installed for
              you, and then you simply need to type <code>argonone-ir</code>
              into the terminal to get it set up.

            <h2>Some Optional Polish</h2>
            <h3>Window Decorations</h3>
            <p>
              Plasma Bigscreen is designed to work one window at a time,
              so if you minus a window without a keyboard, then you've
              essentially lost it for good. In settings you can remove
              the titlebar buttons for max/min and hide, and just leave
              the one to close the window with.
            </p>

            <h3>Splashscreen</h3>
            <p>
              In KDE settings change the splash screen from the default
              KDE one to the Plasma Bigscreen one, so that while you wait
              for your smart TV to boot up, you can relish in your
              accomplishment of having the most obscure smart TV out of
              everyone you know.
            </p>

            <h3>XScreensaver</h3>
            <aside>
              Note: It looks like this version of Bigscreen doesn't cooperate
              with XScreensaver very well. I've encountered 2 issues so far:
              firstly: the login scripts don't load up, and secondly:
              if the login scripts load up, then XScreensaver gets called
              after "inactivity" when watching content in fullscreen mode,
              which shouldn't happen. This, however, worked fine when using
              an X86 device with arch linux and the newer version of
              Bigscreen.
            </aside>
            <p>
              XScreensaver has a pretty cool analog tv effect screensaver
              that will cycle through images in a folder and display them
              with various tv static effects:

          <section id="not-quite-full-screen">
            <h2>Not Quite Full Screen</h2>
            <p>
              KDE's window management isn't quite perfect, and full screen
              often falls short by 1 pixel on the right and bottom borders
              (despite any window rules you might add). This can be an
              irritant when a bright wallpaper sits behind whatever you're
              watching. The easiest fix is to set a dark-edged wallpaper.
              The newer bigscreen lets you use kde settings which is nice
              as you can set the wallpaper to plain colour black, but in
              the debian version you have to use the built in wallpaper
              settings app found in the bigscreen settings menu on the
              home screen. It will only show you the wallpapers that are
              installed, so download your dark wallpaper, then move it to
              the wallpaper folder and then it will show up in the wallpaper
              changer application:
