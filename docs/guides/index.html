   Some guides on things that I have worked on where resources are
    either hard to find or scattered. You might save yourself some
    time or learn something new if you're working on anything that
    comes up in this section.

<main><div class="article"><h3>AppSheet - Rota App</h3><date datetime="2025-08-28">28th August, 2025</date><ul class="topic-container"><li class="topic">appsheet</li><li class="topic">apps script</li><li class="topic">google</li><li class="topic">sheets</li></ul><a href="/guides/appsheet">Go to article</a><p class="description">I first found out about AppSheet a number of years ago when it was still a fairly new project. I was running my own skate school and needed something that could organise data while on the move; specifically bookings I had made with clients. I had looked at a lot of options which didn't quite make the cut of what I needed. But then I stumbled across AppSheet, and it did just about everything I needed it to. Well, almost everything. But as it uses Google Sheets as pseudo-databases, I was able to use Apps Script to fill the last few gaps, and have my own custom software .. for free!</p></div><div class="article"><h3>TV Show Calendar - Github Actions</h3><date datetime="2025-07-06">6th July, 2025</date><ul class="topic-container"><li class="topic">cicd</li><li class="topic">python</li><li class="topic">apps script</li><li class="topic">google</li></ul><a href="/guides/tv-show-calendar">Go to article</a><p class="description">It's pretty hard keeping track of my favourite show's nowadays across all the different services. So I set up my own automated workflow that eventually finds it's way to a Google Calendar so I can see at a glance when the next episode of a show I'm following is due to air. And, of course, it's completely free!</p></div><div class="article"><h3>RSS Feeds</h3><date datetime="2025-06-18">18th June, 2025</date><ul class="topic-container"><li class="topic">webdev</li><li class="topic">xml</li><li class="topic">python</li></ul><a href="/guides/rss-feeds">Go to article</a><p class="description">RSS isn't really something you hear spoken about too often. But for us nerds, it's an indisposable technology. And thankfully, it still gets used. Most of the time, if you need an RSS feed for content you've made, the software you've used to make said content has probably already done it for you, you might need not even know. But if you had to make one yourself, would you know how?</p></div><div class="article"><h3>Web Fonts</h3><date datetime="2025-04-05">5th April, 2025</date><ul class="topic-container"><li class="topic">webdev</li><li class="topic">fonts</li><li class="topic">web fonts</li><li class="topic">css</li><li class="topic">html</li><li class="topic">gdpr</li></ul><a href="/guides/web-fonts">Go to article</a><p class="description">If you've ever used an older or lower spec device, or had a slow connection on a public wifi network, you may have noticed the fonts on a web page get loaded after the content and layout. Most of the time this is virtually unnoticable, but once you've seen it, as with most things traumatic, it is hard to unsee it. But there are a few steps we can take to mitigate this from happening.</p></div><div class="article"><h3>Watchy - Arduino IDE</h3><date datetime="2024-08-25">25th August, 2024</date><ul class="topic-container"><li class="topic">watchy</li><li class="topic">arduino</li><li class="topic">python</li></ul><a href="/guides/watchy">Go to article</a><p class="description">I didn't intend to write an article about Watchy, as I only bought it to satisfy my nerd fetish. But after the trouble I had getting it to work, I thought I might write a short guide to assist anyone who might run into some of the same issues I did.</p></div><div class="article"><h3>Firefox Web Apps - Plasma Bigscreen</h3><date datetime="2024-08-22">22nd August, 2024</date><ul class="topic-container"><li class="topic">raspberry pi</li><li class="topic">rpi4</li><li class="topic">smart tv</li><li class="topic">kde bigscreen</li><li class="topic">streaming</li></ul><a href="/guides/firefox-web-apps">Go to article</a><p class="description">With the introduction of Web Manifest V3, ad blocking in Chromium based browsers is changing. the new limitations and API's for browser extensions means ad blockers, such as Ublock Origin are less effective than they once were. Firefox will still be using Manifest V2 for a while yet, but the fact that Firefox, on the dekstop at least, does not have support for PWA's (progressive web apps) may hinder the user experience for those off us using Plasma Bigscreen as a streaming OS. Luckily, Linux is flexible, and there's an easy way to get Firefox Web Apps.</p></div><div class="article"><h3>Google Calendar API - Apps Script</h3><date datetime="2024-06-21">21st June, 2024</date><ul class="topic-container"><li class="topic">webdev</li><li class="topic">google</li><li class="topic">ical</li><li class="topic">apps script</li><li class="topic">javascript</li></ul><a href="/guides/google-calendar-appscript-api">Go to article</a><p class="description">Considering how long they've been around, working with iCal's in the browser is surprisingly difficult. When working with data from Google Calendar, we can use Google's Apps Script to create an API, that will let us pull exactly what we desire down from a Google Calendar.</p></div><div class="article"><h3>Static Website - Github Pages</h3><date datetime="2024-06-09">9th June, 2024</date><ul class="topic-container"><li class="topic">webdev</li><li class="topic">seo</li><li class="topic">xml</li><li class="topic">python</li></ul><a href="/guides/github-pages-static-website">Go to article</a><p class="description">You don't always need a full stack. When all you need to do is show information, a static website is enough. And with Github Pages, it is possible to have a fully functioning website for free, just like this one! It could just be the perfect solution for your portfolio page.</p></div><div class="article"><h3>Raspberry Pi 5 - Desktop Computer</h3><date datetime="2024-05-31">31st May, 2024</date><ul class="topic-container"><li class="topic">raspberry pi</li><li class="topic">rpi5</li><li class="topic">computing</li><li class="topic">daily driver</li></ul><a href="/guides/pi5-desktop">Go to article</a><p class="description">This is less of a guide, and more just an outline of how, and why, I'm doing it. As well as a review of how it's going. It's not here as clickbait, you might not want to do it yourself, but I'm here to say that it's working for me.</p></div><div class="article"><h3>GPi Case 2 - Compute Module 4</h3><date datetime="2024-04-28">28th April, 2024</date><ul class="topic-container"><li class="topic">raspberry pi</li><li class="topic">cm4</li><li class="topic">recalbox</li><li class="topic">gaming</li><li class="topic">handheld</li></ul><a href="/guides/gpicase">Go to article</a><p class="description">The GPi Case 2 with Raspberry Pi's Compute Module 4 is the ultimate portable gaming device. The case offers amazing functionality, and when combined with a CM4 and 64-bit Recalbox, there is little that can challenge it for a portable retro gaming experience.</p></div><div class="article"><h3>RetroPie - RetroFlag NesPi 4 Case</h3><date datetime="2024-04-23">23rd April, 2024</date><ul class="topic-container"><li class="topic">raspberry pi</li><li class="topic">rpi4</li><li class="topic">retropie</li><li class="topic">gaming</li><li class="topic">lightgun</li><li class="topic">wiimote</li></ul><a href="/guides/retropie-nespi-4">Go to article</a><p class="description">The Raspberry Pi 4, with Retroflag's NesPi 4 Case, running RetroPie is the ultimate retro gaming rig. Low power consumption? Check. Light gun games? You got it. Great customisation options? Of course. Did you know you can even use a wiimote as the stylus for the Drastic Nintendo DS Emulator?? Did I hear someone say Wario Ware?</p></div><div class="article"><h3>Media Keyboard - Pico Controller</h3><date datetime="2024-04-14">14th April, 2024</date><ul class="topic-container"><li class="topic">pico</li><li class="topic">microcontroller</li><li class="topic">circuitpython</li><li class="topic">python</li><li class="topic">gpio</li></ul><a href="/guides/media-keyboard">Go to article</a><p class="description">My keyboard doesn't include the media keys, so I built a macro keyboard to control the media on my desktop computer. It is plug'n'play and requires no configuration to work between different devices. The project can be easily tweaked to program macro's for work, steam games, and whatever else you can't be bothered to type out manually.</p></div><div class="article"><h3>KDE Plasma Bigscreen - Raspberry Pi 4</h3><date datetime="2024-04-02">2nd April, 2024</date><ul class="topic-container"><li class="topic">raspberry pi</li><li class="topic">rpi4</li><li class="topic">smart tv</li><li class="topic">kde bigscreen</li><li class="topic">streaming</li></ul><a href="/guides/kde-plasma-bigscreen">Go to article</a><p class="description">I built this media centre at the start of 2024. There may be easier methods of installation by now. When I built this project, existing guides mentioned an installation image on KDE's bigscreen page, however, it doesn't seem to exist currently, except for a manjaro image, and I prefer to stick to Raspberry Pi's own debian OS when I can, especially that it ensures the best compatibility with things like cases and accessories.</p></div></main>
